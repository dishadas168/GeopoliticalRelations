    "0":"Barack Obama should use his powers as President of the United States and pardon the three Cubans that are still imprisoned. This will have the immediate effect of freeing Alan Gross and improving relations between Washington and Havana.",
    "1":"A team from Sydney University traveled to 10,000 Australian beaches, evaluating them on the colors of the water, cleanliness and privacy, and voted the virgin Vivonne Bay beach on South Australia's Kangaroo Island as the best in the country.",

    "3":"Iran is serious about achieving a position on the international stage that's reflective of its reserve potential, the country's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, told an international energy summit in Moscow."
