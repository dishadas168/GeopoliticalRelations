    "1":"But for too many, the bed has become a battlefield. Many millions of us struggle nightly with insomnia, nightmares and other sleep challenges.

Most either arrived as Rubio fans or emerged from the town hall supporting him.  And though many of his policy platforms resonated with the millennial voters, their main attraction to Rubio seemed to be his character."
