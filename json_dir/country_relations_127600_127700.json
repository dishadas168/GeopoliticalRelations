    "1":"Last month, Hawaiian Airlines kicked off non-stop service three times per week between Honolulu and Beijing. If you're planning on visiting China, it's worth a 24- to 36-hour pit stop in the Aloha State for some fun in the sun.",
    "2":"A headline from a Capitol Hill newspaper declared that our current Congress could be the \"worst ever.\" Another said negotiating political agreements is a \"lost art.\"  The whole country knows something is wrong with our government.  It's time it's shown how to fix it, at least the U.S. Senate."
