    "0":"Two Americans are dead and one is on trial for murder. I see so much pain and suffering. One of our most decorated soldiers was shot dead by another American soldier. Worse, it happened as he was trying to help another in his time of need.",
    "1":"If Greece leaves Europe, the EU dream will be gone for good.
