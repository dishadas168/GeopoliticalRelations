    "1":"Some form of military intervention to stop ISIS from overrunning the country and to protect American assets may be inevitable, but the near singular focus on military intervention ignores what should be an obvious lesson of the past dozen years: the U.S. can't bomb its way to victory.",
    "2":"The British approach to the novel implementation of mitochondrial replacement therapy, with extensive public involvement and careful, measured scientific review, may serve as an example for the United States and rest of the world.",
    "3":"Remember to not let work or yourself get in the way when there is a time when a loved one really needs you. Women tend to think they can do it all, but that is not always the case in every situation in your life. It is OK to put work on the back burner during difficult seasons in your life."
