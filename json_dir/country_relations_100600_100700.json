    "0":"If the fictional world of film and TV shows a landscape of female characters who are diverse, who have\u00a0 unique attributes, who are CEOs and doctors and scientists -- how will that inspire our children? Will our children expect women in leadership roles? It should then be normal.",
    "1":"Your daughters believe you when you say that there are no boys out there good enough for them. Sure, a woman doesn't need a man to survive, but let's not raise her thinking that not only does she not need them, but that there actually aren't any good ones."
