    "0":"Last month, the Boy Scouts of America notified me that I would no longer be allowed to serve as leader of my son's Scouts troop, because I'm gay and pose a \"distraction\" to the Scouts' core values. This Mother's Day, I have a message for the Boy Scouts: I am a mother, not a distraction.",
    "1":"What is the greatest gift we can give a mother this Mother's Day?  There are many answers, but one is a healthy life for her and her child. This Mother's Day, let's sharpen our resolve to ensure mothers everywhere have children who are born HIV-free."
