    "1":"The heart of the film, and there is lot of heart here, is watching this band of edgy, self-aware, second-generation NY wiseass Muslim comics extend themselves to people in small town America who sometimes have no idea what to do with them.",

They have been taught to turn a blind eye to institutional racism and structural inequity, and don't see that their civil rights are being violated in more subtle and dangerous ways than ever before.",
    "3":"Drag King K.James described you as a \"female-to-female or FtF drag queen.\" As a cisgender woman, what would you say to those",
    "4":"The Sierra Club and 17 other environmental, environmental justice and public health advocacy groups sent a letter to President Obama in which we asked him to stop basing national energy policy on an \"all of the above\" strategy."
