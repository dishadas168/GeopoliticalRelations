    "0":"Obama's war powers proposal justifies operations against vaguely defined \"associated\" people and entities. Put that together with the post-9\/11 authorization for anti-Al Qaeda operations and you have a blank check to do pretty much anything, anywhere, any time against anyone who evinces admiration\/sympathy\/solidarity for Isis or Al Qaeda.",

    "2":"President Obama is absolutely correct that our nation must confront these ruthless terrorists. But he was also correct to promise that America would not be sending U.S. combat troops back to the Middle East to fight another ground war.",
    "3":"The museum, based in Jerusalem, has amassed a collection of more than 100 cuneiform tablets, original documents from the Judean community, which are now on display to the public for the first time."
