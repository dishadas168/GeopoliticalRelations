    "1":"This entire investigation into the CIA's role in illegal tortures has died, allegedly because the Senate's Sergeant-at-Arms doesn't trust the CIA, the CIA's Inspector General finds the CIA's accusations against the Democratic-led Committee to be based on \"inaccurate information,\" and the U.S. Attorney General asserts that the CIA's case against that Committee isn't worth pursuing."
