# Summary

The PETRARCH2 coding program implements a new coding algorithm, based on a
syntactic constituency parse, to extract who-did-what-to-whom political event data from
structured news stories. Events are coded according to the CAMEO [@cameo] coding
ontology. This software improves upon previous-generation coding software
such as TABARI [@tabari] by using a deep syntactic parse rather than shallow 
parsing.

At the level of assigning codes, PETRARCH2 is largely dictionary based, working from extensive 
dictionaries of verb phrases to identify the type of event, and noun phrases to
identify both the actor (generally a proper noun such as the name of a country or
leader) and agent (generally a common noun identifying a role such as "police" or
"protesters"). These dictionaries incorporate the synonym sets from WordNet, are
open source, and are included in the distribution.

PETRARCH2 has primarily been run using Treebank output from the Stanford CoreNLP
system. It can be integrated with other software on the https://github.com/openeventdata/ site
to handle either continuous near-real-time coding or batch coding, as well as 
auxiliary programs for geolocation and simple deduplication.

As noted above, PETRARCH2 extracts structured political events from news
stories. This software is aimed at users in the social sciences for whom
the extracted political events can serve as basis for research into phenomenon
of interest. Additionally, other users, such as data journalists, data
scientists, and other analysts, can make use of the data generated via
PETRARCH2 as a structured, common representation of news stories.
