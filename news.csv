[],One big problem for Ukraine is clear: Glass,2022-09-19 23:53:31,"There was one topic of conversation among the women bundled up in front of a bombed-out building the other day as they waited in a long line at a humanitarian food truck, a nippy wind swirling around them. ""When are you going to get your glass?"" one asked. ""Have you called about the glass?"" another said. ""It was really cold last night. Didnt you feel it?"" said a third. ""Whens the glass coming?""","There was one topic of conversation among the women bundled up in front of a bombed-out building the other day as they waited in a long line at a humanitarian food truck, a nippy wind swirling around them. ""When are you going to get your glass?"" one asked. ""Have you called about the glass?"" another said. ""It was really cold last night. Didnt you feel it?"" said a third. ""Whens the glass coming?"" This is becoming a big problem in Ukraine. So many windows have been shattered by explosions -- ""millions of them,"" one humanitarian official estimated -- that there is a nationwide run on glass. In the towns and cities that the Russian military has pounded with earthshaking artillery barrages, nothing has been spared -- not the high rises, not the schools, not the squat little cottages. The shock waves from a powerful Russian missile that exploded less than 900 feet from a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Monday blew out more than 100 windows at the plant. Many of the buildings that have avoided total destruction during the war have had all their windows blown out. And winter is coming. Fast. The other week here in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, the temperature dropped from about 80 degrees Fahrenheit to almost freezing. No doubt that Ukraine is facing a host of crises within crises, but one of the most urgent is the scramble to get damaged homes ready for winter, and that is where the glass comes in. Appreciate this material just for a moment, because hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians really need it right now. Glass lets in light and keeps out cold. You can see through it, so no matter how small or cramped your place is, you have a view. Glass keeps out birds, bugs and dust, and you can open a window and let in fresh air. The alternatives, which you can see all over Ukraine now, have obvious deficiencies. Plywood may cover a hole in the wall, but it leaves the inside space dark, which can be depressing. And the scraps of tablecloths or plastic film that a lot of people are using -- one man said he had nothing better than the Ukrainian version of Saran Wrap to cover his windows -- might let in sunlight. But they dont seal well and leave people curled up at night under three blankets, dreading winter. ""That stuff?"" said Oleksandr Zhyla, a retired architect who used the plastic food wrap on his blown-out windows in Chernihiv. He pointed to his handiwork and laughed: ""It doesnt keep us warm at all."" Even before the Russian invasion in February, Ukraine had glass issues. One of its biggest glass factories was in the eastern Donbas region, but it was bombed during the pro-Russian rebellion there a few years ago, and shut down. That left Ukraine relying heavily on Russia and Belarus for glass. But after this war started, those trade links were cut. So now almost all of Ukraines glass, two distributors said, is imported, much of it from pricier European markets. And there are more problems. To make glass, you have to melt sand. And to melt sand, you need a lot of energy. And with global energy prices soaring, glass prices have risen sharply as well. Add all of this up -- the higher production costs, the increased demand, Ukraines logistical nightmares, like its seaports being blockaded by Russian submarines -- and its no mystery that an ordinary pane of glass costs double, triple or even quadruple what it used to, according to glass suppliers. That makes it impossible for many people to fix their windows, even as the cold air begins to blow in. And every day, with the fighting still raging, more are being broken. During a war, windows are always the first to go. If a bomb is powerful enough, the shock waves or reverberations will shatter glass far from the explosion, creating a blizzard of potentially lethal shards. ""You wouldnt believe how small the pieces were,"" said one woman, Nataliia Medvedok, who sat by a blown-out window in her living room in Chernihiv. She had been hiding in a shelter when her building was hit in March and came back to find the floor covered with pea-sized pieces of super-sharp glass. Humanitarian groups have stepped in. A private French aid organization, ACTED, is helping Medvedok pay for her window repair, part of its plan to get people ready for winter. ""Everyone is rushing, rushing, rushing to do what we can, right now,"" said Frances Oppermann, ACTEDs deputy country director for programs. Winter in Ukraine, she said, is ""intense."" Its also long, nearly half the year, with wintry weather stretching from mid-October to mid-March, and temperatures can plummet to 10 below zero. Fixing windows is part of a broader winterization strategy laid out by aid agencies that includes buying tens of millions of dollars worth of blankets, coats, woolen hats and traditional felt boots. In Chernihiv, a first look can be deceptive. It is a beautiful city of about 200,000 people. Gazing across its immense cobblestone town square lined with elegant old buildings and seeing people jogging through the parks with their perfectly clipped bushes, it almost looks as if nothing happened here. But then you notice how many windows are boarded up or missing. Chernihiv was blasted by Russian missiles and rockets in March, but has not seen much fighting since then. While there has been a lightning Ukrainian offensive this month that pushed back Russian troops around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Chernihiv has remained relatively quiet. At the mayors office, there is still plywood covering some of the broken windows. ""I have bigger problems,"" said the mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko. ""I cant have children freezing in their apartments."" His priority is to repair critical infrastructure to ensure the city is ready to turn on the heat when winter arrives, no small feat given the extent of the damage and how expensive energy has become. Mykolaiv, a city in the south, has been shelled mercilessly by Russian forces. Vitaliy Kim, a top local official, said he has 50,000 square meters of windows to fix -- thats almost 10 football fields of glass. ""Even the windows in my own house are blown out,"" he said. Nationwide, the figures are staggering. Some 140,000 residential buildings have been destroyed; 44 million square meters of housing have been damaged; and millions of Ukrainians are living in homes ""ill-suited to provide sufficient protection from harsh winter conditions,"" according to the United Nations. Considering that the front line zigzags for more than 1,000 miles and that Russia has hammered hundreds of places with artillery, its not hard to see how Oppermann came to an estimate of ""millions"" of broken windows. But no one really knows. Zhyla went around his blown-out nine-story building in Chernihiv, counting the broken windows. He found 496. And thats just one building. He is worried that if the windows are not fixed by wintertime, the pipes in his building could turn to ice and burst, and then it will be really hard to live there. ""A simple $100 window can prevent an entire family from freezing this winter,"" said Michael Capponi, the founder of Global Empowerment Mission, an aid group that has installed thousands of windows in Ukraine. Viktoriia Markova, whose home in Chernihiv was smashed to smithereens by an artillery shell, was recently given a small shelter in her backyard for her, her husband and teenage son. It is the size of an ordinary bedroom, and its walls are made of the same material as a porta-potty. Its dark and stuffy inside and smells like plastic. And it doesnt have any real windows. ""Its not great,"" Markova conceded. ""But theres just one thing on everyones mind. Victory. Were all just waiting for victory.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/one-big-problem-for-ukraine-is-clear-glass-517865
[],"As Russian losses mount in Ukraine, so does criticism back home",2022-09-13 17:57:46,"More than 40 local elected officials across Russia signed a two-sentence petition on Monday that ended with: ""We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation!""","More than 40 local elected officials across Russia signed a two-sentence petition on Monday that ended with: ""We demand the resignation of Vladimir Putin from the post of president of the Russian Federation!"" The petition, pushed by opponents of the Ukraine invasion, had no practical impact, and it was roundly ignored in Russias state-controlled media. But it was striking in its very existence, showing that despite the Kremlins extraordinary crackdown on dissent, Ukraines counteroffensive successes have left Putins opponents newly emboldened -- and his supporters looking for someone else to blame. Pro-war commentators and politicians have pointed to the military leadership or senior officials, saying they have not waged the war with sufficient decisiveness and competence, or have not delivered all the facts to Putin. Longtime Kremlin critics have seized on that discord, and Russias setbacks at the front, to take the risk of speaking out against Putin. ""There is now hope that Ukraine will end this war,"" said Ksenia Torstrem, a member of a municipal council in St. Petersburg who helped organize the petition and called Ukrainian advances an ""inspiring factor"" for it. ""We decided we needed to put pressure on from all sides."" On Russian state television, where criticism of the Kremlin is rare, supporters of the war are increasingly pointing fingers over what they cast as a disorganized and insufficiently concerted invasion; others are raising the idea of suing for peace. With anger spreading over the embarrassing withdrawal of Russian troops from more than 1,000 square miles of northeastern Ukraine, one senior lawmaker said in an interview that an ""urgent adjustment"" to the war effort was needed. In a phone interview Monday, that lawmaker, Konstantin F. Zatulin, a senior member of parliament in Putins United Russia party, laid out the stakes. Zatulin described the retreat by Russian troops as doing ""very serious damage to the very idea of this special military operation,"" using the term that the Kremlin has adopted for the war. But he also cautioned that if criticism of the war effort from across the political spectrum spirals out of control, it could lead to unforeseen consequences, citing the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet collapse of 1991. ""It must be underlined that this criticism should not go overboard,"" he said. ""Otherwise, it could spark an uncontrollable reaction."" Zatulin insisted that any optimism by people hoping that Putin would be toppled was ""very much premature."" Ukraines successes, he said, might prompt the Kremlin to escalate its war effort to try to deliver Ukraine a decisive defeat, though he added that he did not expect this to mean ""nuclear war."" ""What now appears to some to be the success of the Ukrainian side could in fact lead to the last drop that will lead to the beginning of a war for real,"" Zatulin said. ""Given that Russia truly did not use the full force of its abilities, nothing remains to be done other than to demonstrate this force."" There is no evidence that Putins hold on power might be weakening, and the Kremlin on Monday said the invasion would ""be continued until the original goals are achieved."" Still, there were gathering signs that Russias elite was unsettled by the armys retreat and uncertain how to proceed. A member of the lower house of parliament, Mikhail Sheremet, told a Russian news outlet that the military would not succeed in Ukraine ""without a full mobilization."" It was an implicit criticism of Putins refusal to carry out a nationwide draft, a step that Russian proponents of an escalated war effort have long been demanding. The leader of a pro-Putin party, Sergei Mironov, praised the strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure targets Sunday night that left parts of the country without power, but complained that they ""should have been carried out two to three months ago."" And on the social network Telegram, where pro-war Russian military bloggers have gained huge followings, the grumbling also continued. ""Stop whining,"" Yevgeny Poddubny, a war correspondent for Russian state television, posted, referring to those who were worried about an escalating war. But a senior member of the upper house, Andrei Klimov, tried to push back against the voices calling for all-out war, telling reporters that he saw no ""necessity"" for a mobilization or for martial law to be declared. Opponents of Putin have been heartened by the discord. ""Many have the hope that something will finally break,"" Ivan I. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg and a critic of Putin, said in a phone interview. ""We are probably wrong, its probably not yet time, but since everyone has been waiting for half a year for something to crack, this hope is very strong."" After the invasion in February, Putin led the most intense crackdown on dissent since taking power two decades ago, signing a censorship law that made any criticism of the war effort -- or even calling it a war rather than a ""special military operation"" -- a potential crime. Thousands of journalists, activists and others fled the country, while just about all the prominent independent news media outlets still operating inside Russia were forced to shut down. Leading opposition figures who refused to flee were jailed. So when a group of municipal council members from Putins home city of St. Petersburg published a statement calling for the president to be removed from office for treason last week, it was a shocking move in an environment in which fear of imprisonment has driven almost all criticism of Putin underground. Some of those council members now face fines for ""discrediting"" the military and government, but in Moscow, members of another municipal council followed suit in calling for Putin to resign. And over the weekend, Torstrem, the St. Petersburg representative, wrote to fellow opposition-minded local deputies in a Telegram chat group: ""I also want to do something."" She was convinced to speak out, she said, both by colleagues who had already published anti-Putin statements and by the military advances of Ukrainian troops. She also noted the unhappiness in the pro-Putin camp, saying it put the Kremlin in a particularly delicate spot. Torstrem, 38, helped draft the petition issued Monday calling on Putin to step down. She was careful not to mention the war, to avoid making any of the signatories vulnerable under the laws that criminalize criticism of it. The petition said only that Putins actions ""do harm to the future of Russia and its citizens."" The petition had 19 signatories from Moscow and St. Petersburg when she published it on Twitter on Monday morning. By the end of the day, the number had grown to more than 40, including municipal representatives from the remote city of Yakutsk in Siberia and from Samara on the Volga River. She acknowledged that it was unclear how, in practice, the petition might help precipitate Putins resignation. But one signatory, Vasily Khoroshilov, a municipal deputy in Moscow, said the idea was to send a message to powerful opponents of Putin that they would have support among the Russian public. ""The radical patriots have also started to doubt the correctness of the path that is being followed,"" Khoroshilov, 38, said in a phone interview. ""Some forces in the highest echelons of power might take some kind of decisive action if they see support among the people."" Putins core supporters appear to be focused on the notion that any problems in the war are not his fault, but that he was being misled by senior officials or the military leadership. That was the message sent by Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman ruler of the southern Russian region of Chechnya. He posted a rambling voice message to his Telegram account over the weekend and warned that if the military did not change its strategy ""today or tomorrow,"" he would be forced ""to speak to the Defense Ministrys leadership and the countrys leadership to explain to them the real situation on the ground."" Zatulin, the senior lawmaker, said that many in Russia believed that ""Putin was wrongly informed and doesnt know everything, that he was deluded."" ""The president himself maintains his authority and is the foundation of stability at this moment,"" Zatulin said. But, he cautioned, ""its clear that any system has its limits.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/as-russian-losses-mount-in-ukraine-so-does-criticism-back-home-515780

[],China sees at least one winner emerging from Ukraine war: China,2022-03-14 23:19:03,"The war in Ukraine is far from over, but a consensus is forming in Chinese policy circles that one country stands to emerge victorious from the turmoil: China. After a confused initial response to Russias invasion, China has laid the building blocks of a strategy to shield itself from the worst economic and diplomatic consequences it could face, and to benefit from geopolitical shifts once the smoke clears.","The war in Ukraine is far from over, but a consensus is forming in Chinese policy circles that one country stands to emerge victorious from the turmoil: China. After a confused initial response to Russias invasion, China has laid the building blocks of a strategy to shield itself from the worst economic and diplomatic consequences it could face, and to benefit from geopolitical shifts once the smoke clears. Chinas leader, Xi Jinping, has avoided criticizing President Vladimir Putin of Russia, but he has also tried to distance China from the carnage. His government has denounced the international sanctions imposed on Russia but, so far at least, has hinted that Chinese companies may comply with them, to protect Chinas economic interests in the West. Xi reached out to European leaders last week with vague offers of assistance in negotiating a settlement, even as other Chinese officials amplified Russian disinformation campaigns meant to discredit the United States and NATO. Officials in Washington claimed, without providing evidence, that after the invasion Russia asked China for economic and military assistance, which a Chinese official denounced on Monday as disinformation. In the end, Chinas leadership has calculated that it must try to rise above what it considers a struggle between two tired powers and be seen as a pillar of stability in an increasingly turbulent world. ""This means that as long as we dont commit terminal strategic blunders, Chinas modernization will not be cut short, and on the contrary, China will have even greater ability and will to play a more important role in building a new international order,"" Zheng Yongnian, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, who has advised senior officials, wrote after the invasion in a widely circulated article. At the heart of Chinas strategy lies a conviction that the United States is weakened from reckless foreign adventures, including, from Beijings perspective, goading Putin into the Ukraine conflict. In this view, which in recent days has been echoed in public statements and quasi-official analyses, Russias invasion has dragged American power and attention toward Europe, making it likely that President Joe Biden, like his recent predecessors, will try but fail to put more focus on China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. ""All the difficulties and all the balancing and all the embarrassment that were talking about, those are short-term,"" said Yun Sun, the director of the China Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, who has studied Beijings actions in the lead-up to the war. ""In the long run, Russia is going to be the pariah of the international community, and Russia will have no one to turn to but China."" Chinas path ahead is by no means certain. Drawing too close to Russia would risk entrenching animosity toward China in Europe and beyond, a possibility that worries Xis government, for all its bluster. And if Germany, France and other allies build up their defenses as promised, the United States could ultimately be freed up to shift more of its military resources toward countering China. Biden has vowed to rally an ""alliance of democracies,"" while American military leaders say they will not let Ukraine distract them from China. ""We also feel very, very anxious because the Russia-Ukraine war will force Europe to lean to the U.S., and then China will be dragged deeper into a dilemma,"" said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. The United States allies in the Pacific, including Japan and Australia, ""will also adopt a stronger military posture. So it all seems unfriendly to China."" Chinas initial stumbles after Russias invasion have also raised concern about Xis ability to navigate the wars aftershocks. He has repeatedly warned Chinese officials that the world is entering an era of upheaval ""the likes of which have not been seen for a century."" Yet those officials seemed ill-prepared for the upheaval of Putins assault on Ukraine. Up to the day of the invasion, they scoffed at warnings that Russia was poised for war, instead accusing the United States of stoking tensions. Since then, they have struggled to reconcile sympathy for Putins security grievances with their often-stated reverence for the principle of national sovereignty, including Ukraines. Xi, in a video conference with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Olaf Sholz of Germany, lamented ""the rekindling of the flames of war"" in Europe. Yet his diplomats have fanned the flames of Russian disinformation, accusing the United States of developing biological weapons in Ukraine. ""This is just not good for Chinas international reputation,"" said Bobo Lo, an expert on China-Russia ties at the French Institute of International Relations. ""Its not just Chinas reputation in the West; I think it also affects Chinas reputation in the non-West, because its essentially associating itself with an imperial power."" China could also face economic disruptions from the war and the Western efforts to punish Russia by restricting trade and cutting off its financial institutions. Chinese officials have denounced such measures, and while the United States and its allies have shown remarkable unity in imposing them, other countries share Beijings reservations about using powerful economic tools as weapons. In any case, Chinas economy is large enough to absorb blows that would cripple others. Chinese companies may even end up well positioned to take advantage of Russias desperate need for trade, as happened when Moscow faced sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Chinas strategy reflects a hardening of views toward the United States since Biden came to office in 2021 -- in large part, because officials had hoped for some easing after the chaotic and confrontational policies of President Donald Trump. ""In its China strategy, the Biden administrations policy continuities with the Trump administration are clearly bigger than any differences,"" Yuan Peng, president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, wrote late last year. ""Biden has repeatedly avowed that the United States is not in a 'new Cold War with China, but China often feels the chill creeping in everywhere."" Whatever happens in the war, China sees its deepening ties to Russia as a way to cultivate a counterweight to the United States. The partnership that Xi and Putin celebrated last month at the Winter Olympics in Beijing has become too important to sacrifice, whatever misgivings some officials have about the war. Arguing that the era of American dominance after the Soviet Unions collapse in 1991 was a historical anomaly, both Xi and Putin have embraced geopolitical doctrines that call for their countries to reclaim their status as great powers. Just as Putin depicts the United States as menacing Russia on its western frontier, Xi sees U.S. support for Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own, as a similar threat off Chinas coast. In recent weeks, Chinese analysts have repeatedly cited the century-old writings of a British geographer, Sir Halford John Mackinder. Whoever controls Central Europe controls the vast landmass stretching from Europe to Asia, he argued. Whoever controls Eurasia can dominate the world. A modern Russian proponent of such thinking, Aleksandr G. Dugin, has written extensively on what he sees as a growing clash between the liberal, decadent West and a conservative Eurasian continent with Russia as its soul. Dugin, sometimes called ""Putins philosopher,"" has built a following in China, appearing in state media and visiting Beijing in 2018 to deliver a series of lectures. His host on that occasion was Zhang Weiwei, a propagandist-academic who has won Xis favor and who last year gave a lecture to the Politburo, a council of 25 top party officials. ""The West should not have become a hegemon in defining universal standards because the West or Europe, or the West in general is only part of humanity,"" Dugin told a Chinese state television interviewer in 2019. ""And the other part, a majority of human beings, live outside the West, in Asia."" Such aversion to international standards for political or human rights, supposedly dictated by the West, has become a recurrent theme in Chinese criticism of the United States. It was the subject of a government position paper in December, intended to counter virtual summit of democratic countries held by Biden, and of a long statement that Putin and Xi issued when they met in Beijing last month. As it turns to Beijing for support against Western sanctions, Russia will become increasingly beholden to China as its diplomatic and economic lifeline, while serving as its strategic geopolitical ballast, analysts say. ""The old order is swiftly disintegrating, and strongman politics is again ascendant among the worlds great powers,"" wrote Zheng of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. ""Countries are brimming with ambition, like tigers eyeing their prey, keen to find every opportunity among the ruins of the old order.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/china-sees-at-least-one-winner-emerging-from-ukraine-war-china-462310

[],The war in Ukraine may be impossible to stop. And the US deserves much of the blame,2022-06-01 07:02:36,"In the Paris daily Le Figaro this month, Henri Guaino, a top adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy when he was president of France, warned that Europes countries, under the shortsighted leadership of the United States, were ""sleepwalking"" into war with Russia. Mr. Guaino was borrowing a metaphor that the historian Christopher Clark used to describe the origins of World War I.","In the Paris daily Le Figaro this month, Henri Guaino, a top adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy when he was president of France, warned that Europes countries, under the shortsighted leadership of the United States, were ""sleepwalking"" into war with Russia. Mr. Guaino was borrowing a metaphor that the historian Christopher Clark used to describe the origins of World War I. Naturally, Mr. Guaino understands that Russia is most directly to blame for the present conflict in Ukraine. It was Russia that massed its troops on the frontier last fall and winter and -- having demanded from NATO a number of Ukraine-related security guarantees that NATO rejected -- began the shelling and killing on Feb. 24. But the United States has helped turn this tragic, local and ambiguous conflict into a potential world conflagration. By misunderstanding the wars logic, Mr. Guaino argues, the West, led by the Biden administration, is giving the conflict a momentum that may be impossible to stop. He is right. In 2014 the United States backed an uprising -- in its final stages a violent uprising -- against the legitimately elected Ukrainian government of Viktor Yanukovych, which was pro-Russian. (The corruption of Mr. Yanukovychs government has been much adduced by the rebellions defenders, but corruption is a perennial Ukrainian problem, even today.) Russia, in turn, annexed Crimea, a historically Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that since the 18th century had been home to Russias Black Sea Fleet. One can argue about Russian claims to Crimea, but Russians take them seriously. Hundreds of thousands of Russian and Soviet fighters died defending the Crimean city of Sevastopol from European forces during two sieges -- one during the Crimean War and one during World War II. In recent years, Russian control of Crimea has seemed to provide a stable regional arrangement: Russias European neighbors, at least, have let sleeping dogs lie. But the United States never accepted the arrangement. On Nov. 10, 2021, the United States and Ukraine signed a ""charter on strategic partnership"" that called for Ukraine to join NATO, condemned ""ongoing Russian aggression"" and affirmed an ""unwavering commitment"" to the reintegration of Crimea into Ukraine. That charter ""convinced Russia that it must attack or be attacked,"" Mr. Guaino wrote. ""It is the ineluctable process of 1914 in all its terrifying purity."" This is a faithful account of the war that President Vladimir Putin has claimed to be fighting. ""There were constant supplies of the most modern military equipment,"" Mr. Putin said at Russias annual Victory Parade on May 9, referring to the foreign arming of Ukraine. ""The danger was growing every day."" Whether he was right to worry about Russias security depends on ones perspective. Western news reports tend to belittle him. The rocky course of the war in Ukraine thus far has vindicated Mr. Putins diagnosis, if not his conduct. Though Ukraines military industry was important in Soviet times, by 2014 the country barely had a modern military at all. Oligarchs, not the state, armed and funded some of the militias sent to fight Russian-supported separatists in the east. The United States started arming and training Ukraines military, hesitantly at first under President Barack Obama. Modern hardware began flowing during the Trump administration, though, and today the country is armed to the teeth. Since 2018, Ukraine has received U.S.-built Javelin antitank missiles, Czech artillery and Turkish Bayraktar drones and other NATO-interoperable weaponry. The United States and Canada have lately sent up-to-date British-designed M777 howitzers that fire GPS-guided Excalibur shells. President Biden just signed into law a $40 billion military aid package. In this light, mockery of Russias battlefield performance is misplaced. Russia is not being stymied by a plucky agricultural country a third its size; it is holding its own, at least for now, against NATOs advanced economic, cyber and battlefield weapons. And this is where Mr. Guaino is correct to accuse the West of sleepwalking. The United States is trying to maintain the fiction that arming ones allies is not the same thing as participating in combat. In the information age, this distinction is growing more and more artificial. The United States has provided intelligence used to kill Russian generals. It obtained targeting information that helped to sink the Russian Black Sea missile cruiser the Moskva, an incident in which about 40 seamen were killed. And the United States may be playing an even more direct role. There are thousands of foreign fighters in Ukraine. One volunteer spoke to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation this month of fighting alongside ""friends"" who ""come from the Marines, from the States."" Just as it is easy to cross the line between being a weapons supplier and being a combatant, it is easy to cross the line from waging a proxy war to waging a secret war. In a subtler way, a country trying to fight such a war risks being drawn from partial into full involvement by force of moral reasoning. Perhaps American officials justify exporting weaponry the way they justify budgeting it: It is so powerful that it is dissuasive. The money is well spent because it buys peace. Should bigger guns fail to dissuade, however, they lead to bigger wars. A handful of people died in the Russian takeover of Crimea in 2014. But this time around, matched in weaponry -- and even outmatched in some cases -- Russia has reverted to a war of bombardment that looks more like World War II. Even if we dont accept Mr. Putins claim that Americas arming of Ukraine is the reason the war happened in the first place, it is certainly the reason the war has taken the kinetic, explosive, deadly form it has. Our role in this is not passive or incidental. We have given Ukrainians cause to believe they can prevail in a war of escalation. Thousands of Ukrainians have died who likely would not have if the United States had stood aside. That naturally may create among American policymakers a sense of moral and political obligation -- to stay the course, to escalate the conflict, to match any excess. The United States has shown itself not just liable to escalate but also inclined to. In March, Mr. Biden invoked God before insisting that Mr. Putin ""cannot remain in power."" In April, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austins explained that the United States seeks to ""see Russia weakened."" Noam Chomsky warned against the paradoxical incentives of such ""heroic pronouncements"" in an April interview. ""It may feel like Winston Churchill impersonations, very exciting,"" he said. ""But what they translate into is: Destroy Ukraine."" For similar reasons Mr. Bidens suggestion that Mr. Putin be tried for war crimes is an act of consummate irresponsibility. The charge is so serious that, once leveled, it discourages restraint; after all, a leader who commits one atrocity is no less a war criminal than one who commits a thousand. The effect, intended or not, is to foreclose any recourse to peace negotiations. The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine has evolved to an awkward stage. Both Russia and Ukraine have suffered heavy losses. But each has made gains, too. Russia has a land bridge to Crimea and control of some of Ukraines most fertile agricultural lands and energy deposits, and in recent days has held the battlefield momentum. Ukraine, after a robust defense of its cities, can expect further NATO support, know-how and weaponry -- a powerful incentive not to end the war anytime soon. But if the war does not end soon, its dangers will increase. ""Negotiations need to begin in the next two months,"" the former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger warned last week, ""before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome."" Calling for a return to the status quo ante bellum, he added, ""Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine but a new war against Russia itself."" In this, Mr. Kissinger is on the same page as Mr. Guaino. ""To make concessions to Russia would be submitting to aggression,"" Mr. Guaino warned. ""To make none would be submitting to insanity."" The United States is making no concessions. That would be to lose face. Theres an election coming. So the administration is closing off avenues of negotiation and working to intensify the war. Were in it to win it. With time, the huge import of deadly weaponry, including that from the newly authorized $40 billion allocation, could take the war to a different level. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine warned in an address to students this month that the bloodiest days of the war were coming.",https://www.wionews.com/opinions-blogs/the-war-in-ukraine-may-be-impossible-to-stop-and-the-us-deserves-much-of-the-blame-483965

Ukrainian forces have recaptured swathes of territory including those Russia claimed were annexed and would remain Russian 'forever'. ""Every day, the cities of Kherson region are subjected to missile attacks,"" Russian-installed Kherson administration chief Vladimir Saldo said in a video message. ""As such, the leadership of Kherson administration has decided to provide Kherson families with the option to travel to other regions of the Russian Federation to rest and study,"" he said. ""We suggested that all residents of the Kherson region, if they wish, to protect themselves from the consequences of missile strikes, ... go to other regions,"" he said. People should ""leave with their children"". The prompt to go applied foremost to residents on the west bank of the Dnipro River, he said. That includes the regional capital, the only major Ukrainian city Russia has captured intact since invading in February. Russia has claimed that it has annexed Kherson region. The region is strategically important. It controls land route to Crimea as well as mouth of the Dnipro river. Russia has annexed Crimea in 2014. Since the start of October, Ukrainian forces have burst through Russia's front lines there in their biggest advance in the south since the war began. They have since been advancing rapidly along the west bank, aiming to cut off thousands of Russian troops from supply lines and potential escape routes across it. Russia has concentrated many of its best-trained troops to defend its grip on Kherson's west bank. But that force can only be supplied across the river, which is several kilometres wide and has few crossings.

The charred body parts of Russian soldiers were still decomposing on the asphalt three weeks later, alongside scattered metal debris and ammunition. A single felt boot, favorite footwear for centuries in Russias frozen villages, lay blackened among the detritus. ""Good shot,"" the Ukrainian commander said with elation, surveying the wreck. A deputy commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, which controlled the area, he asked that he be identified only by his nom de guerre, Sulim. He pointed to blackened chunks of human flesh and bone on the road from Russian soldiers killed in the strike, and added, ""It was all humane, it was all very quick."" ""They came four times,"" Sulim, 40, said. ""Let them come again. I am waiting."" The Russian army has come, again and again, trying to penetrate villages and suburbs around Kyiv for weeks, in what has become a seesaw battle for the critical areas that could be used to enter or encircle and eventually shell the capital. Ukrainian media officers escorted several teams of journalists on a rare visit through villages close to Russian lines in the countryside of greater Kyiv on Friday to show some of the damage from early fighting, as well as the success of the Ukrainian resistance and the counterattacks that Ukraines military has mounted. The villages visited were not among those recently liberated by the continuing Ukrainian counteroffensive, but they had come under attack as Russian forces had tried to seize them two weeks ago. Similar battles are now being waged daily. This spot on the edge of a village, on a highway leading into Kyiv, marked the limit of the Russian advance in the area under Sulims watch. Two tanks -- a T-90 that was hit by the Javelin and a T-72 -- according to the commander, were ambushed on the road March 2 during the first week of the war. A half-dozen burned-out armored vehicles lay nearby -- beside a cluster of houses and in a gully -- wrecks from several skirmishes over the period of a week. Russian forces were still just 4 miles away, but the commander asked that the village names not be published to safeguard his positions. The villages on the front line were mostly deserted, with just a few men and women guarding houses and looking after their livestock. The first line of houses facing the road where the tank battle happened were badly damaged from artillery or tank shells. A farmer, Valerii, 62, who kept cows and sheep in a property below the road said he had lost half of his animals in the fighting. ""Everything is destroyed,"" he said forlornly. ""It was in the morning. I had just fed the animals when the tank came. It was about 100 yards from me. I hid."" He gave only his first name so as not to be further identified. Later he ran into some Russian scouts in the woods and they had let him go, he said, but he was close to tears at the state of his farm. ""They come to our house and are trying to impose their orders,"" he said of the Russians. ""How can they? They should not do that. How can I go into your house and tell you what to do? I come to you, and I should behave according to your rules."" The commander said they had found 10 bodies of Russian soldiers from the battle. ""There were no prisoners,"" he said. Ukrainian forces took away five of the bodies, and the local villagers buried the other five, he said. Their armored vehicles had exploded with such force that the heavy steel hatches and doors had been sheared off and hurled in separate directions. In the gully where two armored personnel carriers had crashed and burned, a military sleeping bag and jacket lay beside one wreck, along with discarded rations and scattered ammunition. As he walked through the wreckage, the commander picked up a soldiers silver dog tag. It bore the number 785 000 and the imprint of the Soviet Army -- VS USSR. He picked up an empty army satchel, with a tag with the name A.G. Gagarin on it and his unit number, 666. ""They did not succeed,"" he said grimly. ""Gagarin is OK, he is dead."" Several soldiers at the scene voiced thanks to the United States for providing Javelin portable antitank missiles and to Britain for sending NLAWs, next generation light anti-tank weapons. Yet despite their success in ambushing the Russian armored vehicles and tanks, the Ukrainian troops were wary of the firepower of the Russian army and kept the visit to their positions short. Ukrainian artillery sounded close by as it fired at Russian positions to the north. Black smoke rose beyond nearby woods where the shells had fallen. ""Personally, we want to close the skies,"" Sulim said, repeating a call by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over the country to save its cities from punishing airstrikes. ""The Russians are bombing civilians, women and children,"" he said. ""Would you want us to bomb you?"" he asked of the Russian population. The commander, who served in Iraq on several tours as part of a Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent, said he was from a region of Ukraine that is close to the Russian border. He said he had often interacted with Russian officers after fighting began in eastern Ukraine in 2014. He told them that if Russia had offered a better life, he would have readily supported a union between the two countries. ""But its not good,"" he said. ""The officers agreed with me. They are not living well there. They live in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but everywhere else they just survive."" At a second village, two powerful Russian missiles had gouged yards-wide craters beside the road, smashing houses and farm buildings in a wide arc. Two Iskander ballistic missiles had struck the village in the first week of the war, Ukrainian military officers said. The missiles were possibly aimed at Ukrainian military positions in the village, but they primarily damaged peoples homes and farms. Yuriy Yunevich, 51, and his family had been asleep at home when the missiles hit at 3 a.m., one just yards from their house. ""Everything was thrown like a wave,"" he said. The walls of his house were buckled and his roof shorn off. His greenhouses were ripped apart, and the cows were lying down amid the broken bricks of their stalls. He sent his wife and children away after that but said he could not leave, because his cows had to be milked and fed, and his German shepherd was expecting puppies soon. He was giving the milk and curd to the soldiers, he said. It was not the time to sell his produce, he added. As he spoke, a sniper rifle shot rang out from a Ukrainian position nearby. Russian positions were barely 1 mile away, soldiers said. ""I think we will not let them in,"" Yunevich said of the Russian army. He rejected any thought of living in peace under the Russians. ""This is our land,"" he said.",https://www.wionews.com/world/at-the-edge-of-kyiv-ukrainians-show-off-their-counteroffensive-465805
[],Why are parties to Russia-Ukraine war prolonging it?,2022-09-29 18:40:15,Backdrop,"Backdrop Russia Ukraine War seems to be entering a deadly phase after seven months, witnessing significant twist in the form of Kremlins declaring victory in hasty referendum in four regions of occupied territory to join Russia, poising itself for complete annexation of occupied areas, having announced partial mobilization calling up 3,00,000 reservists for frontline duties. The recent successes of Ukrainian counteroffensive, as the cumulative military aid over $60 billion poured into Ukraine from US led NATO, seems to have emboldened Zelensky to talk of defeating Russia and getting back his entire territory. Angered NATO, left out of battle by nuclear threat, calling out sham referendum, is looking to table new resolution against it, knowing fully well that it will be vetoed by Russia. Why No Party to the war is thinking of conflict termination? This prolonged war is making everyone in the world vulnerable to inflationary pressures, triggering an unprecedented energy crisis and acute food shortages. In view of that, diplomacy and talks for conflict termination should have been the logical option long back, but no party to the war seems to be thinking about it due to own strategic interest, wanting to make more gains before getting back to negotiation table. All parties know that they cant be outright winners in this war, but all are prolonging their agony to avoid being an outright loser Russian Stakes Russia is yet to achieve its strategic aim of liberating complete Donbass Region and remaining southern Ukraine to landlock it, to join up with Transnistria. It has suffered heavy casualties and reverses in many regions like Kharkiv. It has received no worthwhile military material support from anyone in the prolonged war; hence consolidating its gains, redeployment of troops in Russian friendly areas by pulling back from unfriendly ones, along with regrouping and rejig in military hierarchy is a sensible option from military perspective. Watch | Russia claims victory in Ukrainian territories, West calls Moscow's referendum votes as 'sham' The awkward, thinly veiled threat by President Putin to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, if Russian ""territorial integrity"" is threatened has put NATO on notice as to how it would respond. The expected annexation post referendum complicates the nuclear threat, as attack on annexed territory may invite nuclear response as per Russian nuclear policy. Also Read | Putin to formalise annexation of Ukraine territory on Friday Putin may not be encouraged with meek support from China, its 'strategic partner with no limit seemingly responding within careful limits, and comments like 'Not an era of war from otherwise impartial India. Russia might end up with extension of direct land border with NATO by over 1000 Km in terms of Finland joining it. It also continues to suffer standoff attacks from Ukraines recently acquired long range capabilities including drones and clandestine raids of special forces and non-state actors like blasts in Crimea. Russia is aware of its limitations in the areas of economic, diplomatic, information warfare, and political warfare. Russia's much-criticised partial mobilisation and call for reservists is comparable to Ukraine's, which carried it out while under Martial Law, seven months ago and was praised by Western media, highlighting information war against Russia. As a result, it will be prone to hold onto its existing territorial gains and prolong the conflict into the winter, which could favor a new offensive to accomplish remaining military objectives to give itself a stronger negotiating position to have the sanctions lifted. Ukrainian Stakes Having accepted so much of political, strategic and military investment of NATO in his country and tasted some success in his counteroffensives, President Zelensky, posing to be fighting on behalf of US led NATO to weaken Russia, is not in a position to back out from prolonging the war. Also Read | In maps: This is how Ukraine will look like if Russia annexes occupied regions Ukraine cannot overlook the fact that it has lost 15% of its original land since being independent, is left with over 10 million refugees, devastated towns, suffered significant casualties, and its hyped democracy is struggling under martial law and referendum. While US-led NATO's military assistance and arsenal can increase its combat power to launch standoff attacks, regaining lost ground from the Russians will be very difficult because they will use built-up areas for defending their gains in a manner similar to how Ukrainian troops did, more so under nuclear hangover. NATO's military support to pursue war will not bring Ukraine any closer to peace; nevertheless, it may result in long-term changes to its territorial configuration, unending proxy war, and enhance long term Russian threat. President Zelensky is aware that the western narrative and information war that portrays him as a hero and clear victor is unsustainable, yet he will prolong the conflict in order to safeguard his political survival and continued aid. NATOs Stakes NATO may be encouraged by successes of Ukrainian counter-offensives, and its own gains in non-kinetic, non-contact, undeclared war against Russia in economic, information, diplomatic and political domains, but concerned that it cant take Putins nuclear threat lightly, because a tactical nuclear strike from cornered Russia is within the realms of possibility, if Russia declares newly acquired territory as its integral part, post successful referendum and applies the policy of escalate to de-escalate. The United States may benefit from sales of arms, energy, and post-conflict construction contracts in Ukraine, and it may justify recent increases in aid in order to pursue its goal of weakening Russia in order to fend off potential rivals in Europe, but its biggest strategic loss is bringing Russia, China, and Iran closer than ever before in a strategic partnership. It may be beginning of adoption of alternate global/localised financial systems, undermining its grip on current global financial system. NATO, encouraged by soft Russian response to the bid of Finland and Sweden to join NATO, is keen to add both with strong militaries, to secure its northern flank for better collective security posture in the long run. It also makes sense in context of Sino-Russian footprints in Arctic region and North Atlantic Ocean. NATO will continue to urge Russia to end the conflict while supporting Ukraine in its proxy war until last Ukrainian remains because holding negotiations when a sizable portion of the land is in Russian hands will be viewed as NATO's weakness. With millions of refugees mixed in with activated mercenaries and a longer border with belligerent Russia, which will reorganise itself after learning from its mistakes, the war is undoubtedly not making Europe more peaceful. It has signaled its willingness to sacrifice its energy and economic interests in order to achieve that goal. To effectively combat unfriendly Russia in the long run, the EU will need to increase its defence spending while holding some sovereign decisions hostage to the USA. Way Ahead Despite the narrative and rhetoric of the west, Ukraine may not recapture a sizable amount of territory, but standoff strikes, proxy war, clandestine operations, and some ground operations to cause Russian fatalities will continue in the coming days, inviting an equal or stronger Russian reaction. In the Big powers contestation in Ukraine, the global need is that this war should end, but the negotiations are unlikely, because Russia has not yet achieved its strategic objectives on the ground, which is essential to persuade NATO to lift sanctions. On the other side, US led NATO doesnt have any leverage to restrain Putin, so it finds weakening Russia by ongoing proxy war, without sharing any burden of body bags, as the most convenient option. This is especially true when Zelensky is prepared to take this move because he understands that without US support, he will lose his position of power. In current phase of offensive, Russia seemed to have reached its culmination point before seizing center of gravity of Ukrainian forces, a situation which is uncomfortable for any attacker in military campaign. The referendum and nuclear threat by Russia have pushed the war into next phase, with NATO yet to work out its responses.

[],'We are still in shock': A month trapped by Russian forces in a basement,2022-06-10 19:08:37,"More than two months after the residents of Yahidne kicked down the bolted basement door where the Russian army had held them hostage, the village is being rebuilt but the memories remain fresh -- and deeply painful.","More than two months after the residents of Yahidne kicked down the bolted basement door where the Russian army had held them hostage, the village is being rebuilt but the memories remain fresh -- and deeply painful. On March 3, eight days after the full-scale invasion began, Russian forces swept into Yahidne, a village on the main road north of Ukraines capital, Kyiv. For nearly a month, until March 31, when Ukrainian troops liberated the town, more than 300 people, 77 of them children, were imprisoned in several rooms in the dank basement of the village school -- a human shield for the Russian troops based there. Ten of the captives died. Among those held inside were a baby and a 93-year-old, Ukrainian prosecutors said. ""This is our concentration camp,"" said Oleh Turash, 54, one of those imprisoned, who helped bury the people who perished there. For most of the time there was virtually no light. Despite the freezing winter weather, he said, people were packed in so tightly their body warmth was all the heat they needed. But there was never enough oxygen to breathe normally, causing some people to black out and others, mainly older, to suffer hallucinations. ""They would start babbling about the need to plant potatoes, and other things that they could not do,"" said Ivan Petrovich, the schools janitor. Turash, 54, slept in the largest room. It had the only source of air, a tiny hole the people made themselves, Petrovich said. A bucket sat at the far side of the room, a makeshift toilet for children and others who could not wait until morning, when there was hope that the Russian soldiers would let people out to use the regular toilets. A tally on the door of the largest room noted that 136 people had stayed there, nine of them children. Originally, the number had been 139, but that had been scratched out to reflect three deaths, Turash said. ""Three people died around me,"" said his 73-year-old mother, Valentyna. She had broken her right arm going down the stairs to the basement, but received no medical treatment. Her wrist is still swollen three months later. ""I am still in a lot of pain, and I cant use my fingers as well as I used to,"" she said. She said the room she was in was so crowded there was no space for her to move. ""I spent 30 days just like this, hardly moving,"" she said, squatting down low to the ground. ""Twice, I lost consciousness because of the lack of oxygen, but my son banged on the door to get me out. Thank God I survived."" Petrovich and Turash brought crayons for the children to draw. Inside, they drew a mural on the wall composed of Ukrainian flags, hearts, suns and butterflies. At the top, a child had written, ""No War!!!"" In a smaller room, about 25 by 10 feet, there was another amended body count: 22 people, including five children, had been written in pencil. Someone writing in navy blue crayon had changed the number to 18. On one wall was a tally of the dead and the date they had died. One man, Anatoly Shevchenko, had a question mark next to his name. His fate is still a mystery. Every few days, if the captives were lucky, the Russians would give them permission to take the bodies into the schools boiler room, usually several at a time. That was also where they got their drinking water. The men would go through an opening and climb down a ladder to a sewer line, where they would fetch water used in normal times for the schools heating system. Once they got the water, they would boil it over the open flame that they used to cook, when they were allowed to. ""Imagine, there were dead bodies here on this table,"" Turash said. ""And just next to the corpses, we were boiling the water that we drank."" At one point the Russian soldiers conscripted Turash and others to dig a pit at least 10 feet deep next to the boiler room. ""I thought I was digging my own grave,"" he said. Instead, the Russians eventually installed a generator there. Every week or so, after some negotiating, the soldiers would grant Turash permission to bury the deceased outside in a communal grave. They accompanied him, as they did all villagers who got permission to leave the basement, with their Kalashnikovs raised. The residents were able to get intermittent, and inconsistent, food supplies under soldiers watch. Outside, the school was surrounded by Russian tank positions. The soldiers had felled trees from the forest behind the school and dug foxholes for themselves, stealing rugs from peoples homes to put inside the mud dwellings. Turash recognized his own boots on a soldiers feet. The occupiers told some of the residents there were plans to bring them to Russia. ""They told us, 'The men will go to Tyumen to work in wood production and the women will be sent to another part of Russia to work cleaning fish,"" said Ekaterina Balanovych, referring to a city in western Siberia. On March 30, when the Russian forces began retreating from the north, the soldiers locked everyone inside, bolted the door and ordered them not to leave. That night the villagers broke down the door and quickly realized the Russians had left. But they could hear heavy fighting nearby, and most remained inside, waiting to be rescued. But they found an old phone, Balanovych said, and someone was able to reach one of the Ukrainian troops. ""When our boys arrived, we were so happy, we hugged them, and we cried,"" she said. ""They brought bread. We hadnt seen a crumb of bread for a month."" More than two months later, however, Yahidne is far from back to normal. The school is badly damaged, perhaps beyond repair. The wrecked tanks and armored vehicles have been towed away but the evidence of the occupation -- underground dwellings, recently extinguished fires and the scattered belongings of those forced to live in the basement -- remain. Some, like Petrovich, appear to be suffering depression or some form of PTSD. ""After two months, we are still in shock,"" he said. ""There is so much work to do at home still, but you cant lift your hand. It is scary."" There is still a lot of cleaning up to do. ""There is not a single house here where there was no tank or armored personnel carrier standing,"" said Valentyna Sezonenko, 75, who found partly unexploded ordnance on the road in front of her house. Houses across the street and next door had been razed. On a street next to the village's destroyed events hall, volunteers from the capital were putting new roofs on apartment buildings. A shell from a cluster munition lay nearby. ""My soul hurts,"" said Nina Shish, who managed to flee Yahidne hours before it was occupied only to be trapped in a basement by Russians in a neighboring village. As soon as she returned to Yahidne, she went to see the local school, where she had worked and where her granddaughter had been in kindergarten. ""I have no words for my grief, the school was so beautiful before,"" she said. ""Now, students wont learn there any more.""

On Wednesday, Ukraines chief prosecutor announced eight new war crimes cases, including one against nine Russian soldiers accused of terrorizing Yahidne. ""Unfortunately, these people are not located here physically, and we are going for an in absentia trial, but it is very important for us, for Ukrainian justice, for the victims and their relatives to have this legal process,"" the prosecutor general, Irina Venediktova, wrote on Facebook on Wednesday.

[],"For the US, a tenuous balance in confronting Russia",2022-03-19 23:24:16,"In the first weeks of the first major European land war of the 21st century, the United States has sent tank-killing weapons to Ukrainian forces, but not fighter jets. It is equipping embattled Ukrainian troops with lightweight ""kamikaze"" attack drones, but not, at least in an obvious way, conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade Russias technological advantage.","In the first weeks of the first major European land war of the 21st century, the United States has sent tank-killing weapons to Ukrainian forces, but not fighter jets. It is equipping embattled Ukrainian troops with lightweight ""kamikaze"" attack drones, but not, at least in an obvious way, conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade Russias technological advantage. The White House will commit no U.S. or NATO planes to the skies above Ukraine, a move U.S. officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration, but it is providing Ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying Russian aircraft. Such is the tenuous balance the Biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de-escalation. Navigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions and sometimes tortured distinctions when it comes to what kinds of assistance Washington should provide, even as the situation on the ground evolves, pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine pleads with Congress and President Joe Biden to do more to help. The balancing act informs every aspect of U.S. policy about the war, including the scope of the punishing sanctions imposed on the Russian economy, the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to Ukrainian troops, the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether, as Biden did this past week, to label President Vladimir Putin of Russia as a war criminal. CIA officers are helping to ensure that crates of weapons are delivered into the hands of vetted Ukrainian military units, according to U.S. officials. But as of now, Biden and his staff do not see the utility of an expansive covert effort to use the spy agency to ferry in arms as the United States did in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union during the 1980s. They have judged that such a campaign would be an unnecessary provocation, in part because NATO supply lines remain open and there is a functioning government in Kyiv, Ukraine. The new war has forced a recalculation on other fronts. In one example, U.S. officials have floated the idea of Turkeys government providing Ukraine with the sophisticated S-400 anti-aircraft system. It is the very system, made by Russia, that U.S. officials punished Turkey -- a NATO ally -- for buying from Moscow several years ago. Now U.S. diplomats see a way to pull Turkey away from its dance with Russia -- and give the Ukrainians one of the most powerful, long-range anti-aircraft systems in existence. In the White House and the Pentagon, there have been active debates over which lethal weapons delivered to Ukraine meet the nuanced interpretations of what international law allows. U.S. officials acknowledge that the judgments of government lawyers are valuable only up to a point and that all that really matters is the judgment of one person: Putin. The Russian president has his own complex calculus about when the military support to Ukraine from the United States and its NATO allies crosses the line. He has his own reasons not to escalate, given the combined power of the NATO members and his own militarys evident difficulties against Ukrainian forces. But he is also unlikely to accept defeat or a stalemate in Ukraine without further testing U.S. resolve, despite explicit public warnings from Washington against the use of chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence about Putins decision-making is maddeningly imprecise, and the West does not have a strong track record predicting what he might consider an aggression that cannot be tolerated. CIA Director William Burns told Congress this month that Putins views had ""hardened over the years."" The Russian threshold could also be changing by the day or even the hour. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that his country was prepared to raise the costs for any nation helping the Ukrainians in their struggle, declaring that all vehicles shuttling weapons into Ukraine would be considered legitimate military targets. A Clash Over Fighter Planes On Wednesday, the task of articulating the intricacies of the U.S. military policy toward Ukraine fell to a group of generals under a barrage of questions from top members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees. Biden has made clear that he will not accede to Zelenskyys insistent pleas that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Clearing hostile aircraft from the skies would put the United States and its allies in combat with Russian forces. And a required step for a no-fly zone -- suppressing enemy anti-aircraft weaponry -- would mean attacking Russian air defense installations inside Russian territory. But during the closed-door session, lawmakers pressed members of the Pentagons Joint Staff about another flashpoint: the administrations decision not to help supply Ukraine with the MiG-29 fighter jets that Poland has offered and that Zelenskyy has said his forces desperately need. Administration officials have said the move would be ""escalatory,"" and, according to people briefed on the exchanges, the lawmakers asked the generals if there was any hard intelligence that the jets might push Putin toward intensifying the conflict by treating the United States as a ""co-belligerent"" in the war. Intelligence officials have, in fact, told the administration that the MiGs could trigger a Russian move against NATO. During the congressional briefing, the generals said that the main issue was the capability of a MiG-29 to threaten Russian soil. In contrast to a Javelin anti-tank missile that has only limited range on the battlefield, a MiG-29 could fly from Kyiv to Moscow in a matter of minutes, the generals said, a capability that the Kremlin might see as a direct threat. The same day, the White House put forth another consideration: that to be delivered to Ukraine, the MiGs would have to take off from an air base in a NATO country, possibly inviting retaliation on NATO territory by the Russians. As a matter of international law, the provision of weaponry and intelligence to the Ukrainian army has made the United States a co-belligerent. But while Putin has made threats about launching attacks to impede the military assistance, he has not yet acted to stop it by attacking bases in neighboring countries -- NATO allies -- where the equipment originates. That could change, U.S. officials said, especially if Putin thinks he is cornered or in danger of losing. ""It is a fine line the administration is still walking in every dimension of its support for Ukraine,"" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior intelligence official who specialized in Russia and is now at the Center for a New American Security. ""They are trying to figure out, how do you get right up to the line without crossing over in a way that would risk direct confrontation with Russia?"" Planes with pilots might be off the table, but armed drones are not. This past week, Biden announced that the United States would ship small Switchblade drones to Ukraine that could be used to blow up Russian armored vehicles. The single-use kamikaze drones have bladelike wings; do not require either a long runway or a complex satellite uplink; and can be controlled to dive-bomb tanks or troops, self-destructing when they explode. Unlike the large Predator and Reaper drones used for decades in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries, the portable drones pose no threat to Russian soil. Still, the White House authorized an initial shipment of only 100 of them to Ukraine -- a small batch that could be intended to see how Putin reacts to their deployment on the Ukrainian front lines. Depending on the response, hundreds or thousands more could be on the way. The proposal for Turkey to supply Ukraine with Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft systems would also test what Putin is willing to accept from NATO -- and how far a NATO ally that in recent years often appeared to be building bridges to Moscow is willing to go in reiterating its commitment to the alliance and backing Ukraine. The idea came up when Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, visited Turkey two weeks ago. Sherman declined to talk about her discussions. A different senior U.S. official said the United States knew the proposal would anger Putin. Ukraine already uses Turkish-made drones, but Turkey is worried that providing the anti-aircraft systems could make the country a target of Russias wrath. At the same time, the upside for Turkey could be substantial: It was suspended by the Trump administration from the F-35 fighter program -- in which it was a buyer and a manufacturer of parts for the advanced aircraft -- after its purchase of the Russian S-400s. A deal to send the anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine could open the door to reentry into the F-35 program. The State Department declined to comment. Officials at Turkeys embassy in Washington did not respond to messages seeking comment. The Conflict of the Future, Delayed The Ukraine war features tank columns and trenches, all features of Europes bloody conflicts of the past century. Thus far, there is little evidence that the United States -- or Russia -- is eager to escalate the conflict in the 21st century battleground of cyberspace. Days before the war began, there was a flurry of cyberattacks on Ukrainian financial institutions and government ministries, including one that was found and partly neutralized by Microsoft. A European satellite system sometimes used by the Ukrainian military was also hit, knocking out service, although it is still unclear whether the Russians carried out the attack. What has been missing thus far is a large-scale Russian cyberattack that knocks out the power grid or communications systems inside Ukraine, which for the most part continue to operate despite the withering Russian barrage of artillery and airstrikes. Until the invasion began, U.S. Cyber Command had a unit based in Kyiv that was helping the government fend off attacks. It is now operating from a nearby NATO country. There is fragmentary evidence that the United States and its allies worked to counter some of the attacks and to prevent others from being launched. But action seems to have been limited. Inside the Biden administration, there is a view that Putin could be choosing his moment to launch a cyberattack against the U.S. financial system in retaliation for the devastating financial sanctions imposed on his country by the United States and its allies. Unless and until that happens, the administration appears resolved not to launch a significant first strike and invite retaliation -- especially given the risks to the U.S. economy and financial system if Russia were to target them. Keeping the Temperature Down ""The water in Afghanistan must boil at the right temperature,"" Pakistans then-president, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, told his intelligence chief as Pakistan began supplying the mujahedeen in their grueling battle against Soviet troops in neighboring Afghanistan. In other words, hot enough to convince the Russians that the country was not worth the struggle but not so hot as to provoke a broader war in the region. The weapons that helped turn the tide of that conflict, shoulder-fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles, are now being unloaded from cargo planes in NATO countries and delivered to Ukrainian troops on the front lines to help keep Russia from controlling the skies. U.S. officials are divided on how much the lessons from Cold War proxy wars, like the Soviet Unions war in Afghanistan, can be applied to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Some officials say those conflicts established that the great powers could ship small arms and missiles to proxy forces without triggering a wider war. At the same time, Ukraine is far more important to Putin than Afghanistan was to Soviet leaders. Given Russias bloody history with Stinger missiles, U.S. officials have been wary of advertising their use in Ukraine. During a trip to an airfield near Ukraines border this month with Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reporters watched Stinger missiles being unloaded from a cargo plane but were barred from disclosing the whereabouts of the base. Even after two senior U.S. officials told the House Armed Services Committee during a public hearing that Stinger missiles were among the munitions being sent to Ukraine, spokespeople avoided using the S-word from the lecterns at the White House and Pentagon. Until this past week. On Wednesday, the White House released a detailed list of the weapons it was providing as part of an $800 million package of arms to Ukraine. At the top of the list: ""800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/for-the-us-a-tenuous-balance-in-confronting-russia-463888

Now 40, and living in Kyiv with her Ukrainian husband, Ryakhovskaya recently called her cousin in Volgograd to tell her the Russians were invading Ukraine. Her cousin did not believe there was an invasion and told her that Russia was only conducting an operation against Nazis there, she said. ""It makes me feel like we are distant forever,"" Ryakhovskaya said in a video call from a house in the countryside near Kyiv, where she fled with her husband and 7-year-old son as the Russian invasion unfolded. ""I cant forgive them. I cant forgive that they are part of this."" Because of their countries complex and intertwined history, many Ukrainians and Russians have relatives from both sides of the border who are now standing on opposite sides of the war. The conflict triggered by President Vladimir Putin of Russia has gone beyond the front lines and into the families of many Ukrainians and Russians, as well as the diasporas of those peoples around the world. The war has already created family rifts and prompted fears among some that relatives will harm each other in battle. ""I have cousins on both sides,"" said Dan Hubbard, a professor at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. ""I dread them killing each other."" Hubbard, 64, was raised in the United States by his mother, who was Russian, and his Ukrainian great-grandmother. He fondly recalled how the two women used to share homemade cabbage pie while playing cards and making fun of each others accents. Today, some members of his family live near Moscow and others are outside of Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city, which is now under siege by Russian forces. Both his Russian and Ukrainian cousins are old enough to enlist in the army. Hubbard says he has been trying to avoid the news because it causes him too much pain. ""I feel for both sides because Russian boys dont even know why they are there,"" he said. ""My cousins are killing one another because of a madmans fantasy."" Zoya, a 25-year-old assistant at a cosmetics company in St. Petersburg, is the daughter of a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father. She grew up near Moscow, but her paternal grandmother spoke to her in Ukrainian, read her Ukrainian poems and sang her Ukrainian songs. ""This conflict is like when your mom and dad have a fight,"" said Zoya, who, like several people interviewed for this article, asked to be identified only by her first name for fear of repercussions in Russia. ""You cant choose one of them because you love them both."" In a 2011 poll, 49% of Ukrainians said they had relatives in Russia, and there were 2.6 million Ukrainian citizens living in Russia in 2015, according to one study. With a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father, Alona Cherkassky grew up in Moscow but spent her summers in Odessa, Ukraine, where her grandparents lived. As an adult, she prided herself on her double heritage. But with the Russian invasion, it has become a source of pain. ""It feels like a very personal attack,"" said Cherkassky, 45, who now lives in London. Cherkasskys cousin Georgy, 44, a Russian animator, lives in Moscow with his wife, who is from Odessa, the seaside city where the Russian navy came ashore during the invasion. He said that his wife did not separate her Ukrainian identity from her adoptive Russian one until recently. ""Of course since they are bombing her homeland, she is thinking of herself more as Ukrainian,"" Georgy said. The kinship bond between Russians and Ukrainians that many people of mixed origin described has also been emphasized by Putin, who has repeatedly pointed out that the countries share a common heritage. But while for many this closeness made the invasion even more devastating, for Putin it was a justification for it. ""On the one side, our president says were all one people,"" said Georgy, ""but on the other side, hes bombing them."" Olena, who has a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father, said her parents were sheltering underground from Russian shelling in the eastern Ukrainian region of Sumy, near the Russian border. Olena said she grew up in both Ukraine and Russia, speaking a mix of both languages, reading literature and listening to a cross-border mix of pop music. Now she lives in France, and she reads her children Russian and Ukrainian fairy tales and sings lullabies to them from both countries. But since Russias invasion, her children have started to ask which country is theirs. ""How can I say I am more Russian or more Ukrainian?"" she asked. ""I never needed to."" Some people torn between the two countries expressed their distress on social media. ""My son is almost 6. His mothers country of birth bombs his fathers,"" Alexander Kolyandr, who identified himself as an analyst for an investment bank in Moscow, wrote on Twitter. ""My moms from Russia, my dads a Russian speaker from Ukraine,"" Evan Gershkovich, a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, wrote on Twitter on the wars first day. ""Today still isnt computing even after weeks of watching this develop in real-time."" In the house where she is staying in the Ukrainian countryside, Ryakhovskaya said she was freezing because when she left Kyiv she was in shock and took only summer clothes. She has now become scared of the dark. At night, she and her family only use headlamps so as to not attract the attention of Russian troops by turning on the house lights. The fallout with her family in Russia has only added to her distress. ""Its even harder because you lose your relatives,"" she said. ""They dont believe a person they know from their childhood,"" she added.

But I think its going to be a long haul,"" Biden said. Moscow abandoned its main bastion in the northeast on Saturday following which Ukrainian troops have recaptured dozens of towns. Russian forces still control about a fifth of Ukraine in the south and east, but Kyiv is now on the offensive in both areas. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych held out the prospects of moving on the eastern province of Luhansk, which together with Donetsk is known as the Donbas.

Dmytro Pysanka is greeted with a kaleidoscope of numbers and lines that, if read correctly, should give him the calculations needed to fire at approaching Russian forces. Still, errors are common in the chaos of battle. To negate them, the commanders of Pysankas artillery unit on the front line in southern Ukraine secured a high-tech range finder, supplied by the West more than a month ago, which uses laser technology to measure distances. But theres an issue: Nobody knows how to use it. ""Its like being given an iPhone 13 and only being able to make phone calls,"" said Pysanka, clearly exasperated. More than 100 days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Western weapons have arrived at the Ukrainian front lines, with more promised. Just Monday, Britain said it would send a sophisticated multiple-launch rocket system, following a similar pledge from the United States days earlier. But training soldiers how to use the equipment has become a significant hurdle. With his aging anti-tank gun, built in 1985, Pysanka and the weathered soldiers who crew the gun need all the help they can get. The high-tech range finder, called a JIM LR -- and likely part of the tranche of equipment supplied by the U.S., said Pysanka -- seemed like a perfect choice. It can see targets at night and transmit their distance, compass heading and GPS coordinates. Some soldiers learned enough to operate it, but then rotated elsewhere, leaving the unit with an expensive paper weight. ""I have been trying to learn how to use it by reading the manual in English and using Google Translate to understand it,"" Pysanka said. The dilemma underscores the array of issues that come with Ukraines frequent calls for high-end Western weapons and equipment, with requests for new anti-tank guided missiles, howitzers and satellite-guided rockets seemingly pinned to their hopes for victory. Those needs are palpable in the region where Pysankas battery is dug in, just northeast of the Russian-occupied port city of Kherson in southern Ukraine. The area was the site of a brief Ukrainian offensive in the past week that slowed as soon the Russians destroyed a key bridge; the Ukrainians lack of longer-range artillery meant they were unable to attempt a difficult river crossing in pursuit, Ukrainian military officials said. But beyond the urgent need for the tools of war, Ukrainian troops need to know how to use them. Without proper training, the same dilemma facing Pysankas unit and their lone range finder will be pervasive on a much larger scale. Analysts say that providing weapons without sufficient training risks repeating the United States failed approach in Afghanistan, where it supplied the Afghan military with equipment that couldnt be maintained without massive logistical support. ""Ukrainians are eager to employ Western equipment, but it requires training to maintain,"" said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia.

The Russian invasion has bonded America to Europe more tightly than at any time since the Cold War and deepened US ties with Asian allies, while forcing a reassessment of rivals like China, Iran and Venezuela. And it has reenergized Washingtons leadership role in the democratic world just months after the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan ended 20 years of conflict on a dismal note. But the new focus on Russia will come with hard choices and internal contradictions, similar to ones that defined U.S. diplomacy during the Cold War, when America sometimes overlooked human rights abuses and propped up dictators in the name of the struggle against communism.

In recent weeks, Western officials have spoken in terms that often echo the grand declarations that followed the 2001 terrorist attacks. On Friday, President Joe Biden said that ""the free world is coming together"" to stand up to Putin -- a phrase reminiscent of President George W. Bushs talk of how ""the entire free world"" was at war against terrorism. In the near term, Moscows aggression is sure to invigorate Bidens global fight for democracy against autocracies like Russia, making vivid the threats to fledgling democracies like Ukraine. Yet three increasingly authoritarian NATO nations -- Poland, Hungary and Turkey -- play key roles in the coalition aiding Ukraine. And the United States is grappling with internal assaults to its own democracy. The war lends urgency to Bidens climate change agenda, reinforcing the need for more reliance on renewable clean energy over the fossil fuels that fill Russian coffers. Yet it has already generated new pressure to increase the short-term supply of oil from the likes of Venezuelas isolated dictatorship and Saudi Arabias authoritarian monarchy. And it creates a powerful new incentive for the United States to find ways of prying President Xi Jinping of China away from Putin, who is likely counting on diplomatic and economic lifelines from Xi amid crushing Western sanctions. But some administration officials see China as a lost cause and prefer to treat China and Russia as committed partners, hoping that might galvanize policies among Asian and European allies to contain them both. While some experts warn that a renewed focus on Europe will inevitably divert attention from Asia, several top White House officials say the United States can capitalize on how the war has convinced some Asian governments that they need to work more closely with the West to build up a global ideological front to defend democracy. ""What we are seeing now is an unprecedented level of Asian interest and focus,"" Kurt M. Campbell, the top White House official on Asia policy, said at a talk hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""And I believe one of the outcomes of this tragedy will be a kind of new thinking around how to solidify institutional connections beyond what weve already seen between Europe and the Pacific,"" he said. Americas approach to the world was already undergoing a major shift, with the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq concluded, and conversations over Islamic terrorism no longer at the fore. Many war-weary Americans welcomed calls for a reduced military footprint overseas by President Donald Trump, who questioned NATOs relevance and even flirted with withdrawing from the alliance. Biden sought to rebuild US alliances, but did so largely in the name of confronting China. The Russian invasion has expanded his mission dramatically and urgently, setting the stage for a seismic geopolitical shift that would pit the United States and its allies against China and Russia at once if they form an entrenched anti-Western bloc. But it also gives Washington a new and nobler sense of purpose, Rhodes said. ""Weve been trying to get to a new era for a long time,"" he said. ""And now I think Putins invasion has necessitated an American return to the moral high ground."" Playing hardball over energy Early signs of how the new U.S. priorities are creating diplomatic quakes have already emerged. On Friday, the United States and its European allies agreed to pause talks with Iran that just days earlier seemed on the verge of clinching a return to the 2015 deal that limited Irans nuclear program. Western nations are refusing a demand by Moscow, which is a party to the Obama-era agreement from which Trump withdrew, for guarantees that its future transactions with Iran be exempted from the sanctions imposed on Russia in recent weeks. ""Its been clear since last weekend that negotiations to revive the Iran deal could not be walled off from the Ukraine war,"" Dalia Dassa Kaye, an Iran expert at the Rand Corp., said Friday. Last year, Biden made a new agreement a core goal of his foreign policy. It is unclear whether one can be struck without Russia, which is a member of the commission that supervises compliance with the deal and would take control of Irans excess enriched uranium. The United States is also looking at Venezuela from a new angle. Senior Biden administration officials travelled to Venezuela two weeks after the Russian invasion, becoming the first to visit the country in years. Venezuela, a partner of Russia, is under heavy US sanctions imposed years ago to weaken the repressive government of President Nicolas Maduro. In 2019, the Trump administration imposed additional sanctions on the state oil company, central bank and senior officials to pressure Maduro to step down. Now, with Biden looking to increase global oil supplies to bring down prices, U.S. officials are talking to Maduros government about buying his oil again. The idea has drawn some sharp criticism in Congress, however, where Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, fumed that ""efforts to unify the entire world against a murderous tyrant in Moscow should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas."" The same imperative on oil is reshaping US diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two Persian Gulf nations that some Biden administration officials view with suspicion or hostility because of their autocratic systems and leading roles in a war in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe. Brett McGurk and Amos J. Hochstein, two senior administration officials, traveled to the Gulf days before the Russian invasion to discuss security and energy issues. However, Saudi Arabia has declined so far to increase oil production, while the United Arab Emirates waited until Wednesday to ask the OPEC nations to do so. U.S. officials were also furious with the UAE for declining to vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn Russia, although it did support a similar resolution later in the UN General Assembly. The unreliability of the two nations and Russias place in the oil economy have increased momentum within the Biden administration to enact policies that would help the United States more quickly wean itself off fossil fuels and confront the climate crisis. This could lead future administrations to devote fewer diplomatic and military resources to the Gulf nations in the long term, even if U.S. officials want them to help on oil now. ""We may see more fundamental questioning about the value of these partnerships,"" Kaye said. ""These states already believe the US has checked out of the region, but their stance on Russia may only strengthen voices calling for a further reduction of US forces in the region."" Israel, the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East, has also staked out a neutral position on the Ukraine war, largely because of Russias presence in the region. But US officials have been more forgiving of Israels stance as Prime Minister Naftali Bennett conducts shuttle diplomacy. He met with Putin for three hours in Moscow on March 5 and then spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone before returning home. U.S. officials said Bennett consulted with them about the talks, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this past week that they ""appreciate the efforts."" Zelenskyy told reporters Saturday that Jerusalem could be a site for peace talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia. Juggling allies in Europe and Asia In Europe, Russias invasion has supercharged the Biden administrations efforts to restore the morale of a NATO alliance that Trump undermined. But the alliance includes three nations -- Poland, Hungary and Turkey -- whose democratic backsliding has troubled the Biden administration. Hungary and Turkey were pointedly excluded from Bidens global democracy summit in December, and the European Union has cut billions of euros of funding to Poland and Hungary for what it sees as erosions of legal and democratic principles. Now all three countries are participating in the coalition against Russia. ""In times of crisis, there is sometimes a tension between our values and our interests,"" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. ""In the short term, were going to have to prioritize pushing back against Russia, at the risk of taking our foot off the gas on the democracy and human rights concerns that had been at the front and center of the Biden administrations agenda."" In the Asia-Pacific region, several important U.S. partners and allies are working with Washington on sanctions and export controls on technology against Russia. These include Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. Some Asian nations have agreed to long-term gas swaps with Europe to help relieve a potential Russian shut-off of energy exports. And Australia has committed to spending $50 million to send weapons to Ukraine, including missiles and ammunition. However, India -- the most populous U.S. partner in the so-called Quad coalition of democracies in Asia -- has refrained from condemning Russias invasion because of decades-old security ties with Moscow. That stance undermines Bidens insistence that democratic nations band together against autocracies. But it is the other Asian behemoth, China, that presents the biggest diplomatic challenge for the United States. China is Russias most powerful partner, and their bond has strengthened in recent years. Even as the Russian military decimates Ukrainian cities and kills hundreds or thousands of civilians, China has signaled that it stands by Moscow by issuing anti-U.S. declarations and amplifying the Kremlins propaganda and conspiracy theories. Xis persistent support of Putin, with whom he shares a drive to dilute US power, has made administration officials wonder whether there is any way to pull them apart on Ukraine. On Thursday, CIA Director William Burns told US senators he believed that Xi was ""unsettled"" by the war. Some China analysts say that if Beijing wants to salvage its reputation with Western nations, particularly in Europe, it might agree to take steps to help Ukraine without directly breaking from Russia. Ryan Hass, a China director on the National Security Council in the Obama White House, proposed testing Beijing with specific requests, such as asking them to provide more humanitarian aid and refrain from recognizing Russian-installed governments in Ukraine or shielding Russia from war crimes investigations. ""If Chinas leaders take concrete actions to relieve suffering,"" he said, ""then lives would be saved and there would be less centrifugal pressure toward cleaving the world into rival blocs.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/ukraine-war-ushers-in-new-era-for-us-abroad-462147

But Friday, he boarded a plane for one more deployment, this time as a volunteer in Ukraine. He checked in several bags filled with rifle scopes, helmets and body armor donated by other veterans.","Hector served two violent tours in Iraq as a U.S. Marine, then got out, got a pension and a civilian job, and thought he was done with military service. But Friday, he boarded a plane for one more deployment, this time as a volunteer in Ukraine. He checked in several bags filled with rifle scopes, helmets and body armor donated by other veterans. ""Sanctions can help, but sanctions cant help right now, and people need help right now,"" said the former Marine, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, and like other veterans interviewed for this article asked that only his first name be used for security reasons. ""I can help right now."" He is one of a surge of U.S. veterans who say they are now preparing to join the fight in Ukraine, emboldened by the invitation of the countrys president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who this past week announced he was creating an ""international legion"" and asked volunteers from around the world to help defend his nation against Russia. Ukraines minister of foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, echoed the call for fighters, saying on Twitter, ""Together we defeated Hitler, and we will defeat Putin, too."" Hector said he hoped to cross the border to train Ukrainians in his expertise: armored vehicles and heavy weapons. ""A lot of veterans, we have a calling to serve, and we trained our whole career for this kind of war,"" he said. ""Sitting by and doing nothing? I had to do that when Afghanistan fell apart, and it weighted heavily on me. I had to act."" All across the United States, small groups of military veterans are gathering, planning and getting passports in order. After years of serving in smoldering occupations, trying to spread democracy in places that had only a tepid interest in it, many are hungry for what they see as a righteous fight to defend freedom against an autocratic aggressor with a conventional and target-rich army. ""Its a conflict that has a clear good and bad side, and maybe that stands apart from other recent conflicts,"" said David Ribardo, a former Army officer who now owns a property management business in Allentown, Pennsylvania. ""A lot of us are watching what is happening and just want to grab a rifle and go over there."" After the invasion, he saw veterans flooding social media eager to join the fight. Unable to go because of commitments here, he has spent the past week acting as a sort of middle man for a group called Volunteers for Ukraine, identifying veterans and other volunteers with useful skills and connecting them with donors who buy gear and airline tickets. ""It was very quickly overwhelming. Almost too many people wanted to help,"" he said. In the past week, he said he has worked to sift those with valuable combat or medical skills from people he described as ""combat tourists, who dont have the correct experience and would not be an asset."" He said his group has also had to comb out a number of extremists. Fundraising sites such as GoFundMe have rules against collecting money for armed conflict, so Ribardo said his group and others have been careful to avoid specifically directing anyone to get involved in the fighting. Rather, he said, he simply connects those he has vetted with people who want to donate plane tickets and nonlethal supplies, describing his role as being ""a Tinder for veterans and donors."" A number of mainstream media outlets, including Military Times and Time, have published step-by-step guides on joining the military in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government instructed interested volunteers to contact its consulates. Several veterans who contacted the consulates this past week said they were still waiting for a response and believed staff members were overwhelmed. On Thursday, Zelenskyy said in a video on Telegram that 16,000 volunteers had joined the international brigade, although it is unclear what the true number is. The New York Times was not able to identify any veterans actively fighting in Ukraine. The outpouring of support is driven, veterans said, by past experiences. Some want to try to recapture the intense clarity and purpose they felt in war, which is often missing in modern suburban life. Others want a chance to make amends for failed missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and see the fight to defend a democracy against a totalitarian invader as the reason they joined the military. To an extent not seen in past conflicts, the impulse to join has been fueled partly by an increasingly connected world. Americans watching real-time video in Ukraine can, with a click, connect to like-minded volunteers around the globe. A veteran in Phoenix can find a donor in London with unused airline miles, a driver in Warsaw, Poland, offering a free ride to the border and a local to stay with in Ukraine. Of course, war is rarely as straightforward as the deeply felt idealism that drives people to enlist. And volunteers risk not only their own lives, but also drawing the United States into a direct conflict with Russia. ""War is an unpredictable animal, and once you let it out, no one -- no one -- knows what will happen,"" said Daniel Gale, who lost a leg in Iraq before going on to teach leadership for several years at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and retiring as a lieutenant colonel. He said he understood the urge to fight but said the risk of escalation resulting in nuclear war was too great. ""I just feel heartsick,"" he said. ""War is terrible and the innocent always suffer most."" The risk of unintended escalation has led the U.S. government to try to keep citizens from becoming freelance fighters, not just in this conflict, but for centuries. In 1793, President George Washington issued a Proclamation of Neutrality warning Americans to stay out of the French Revolution. But the efforts have been uneven, and often swayed by the larger national sentiment. So over the generations, a steady stream of idealists, romantics, mercenaries and filibusters have taken up arms, -- riding with Pancho Villa in Mexico, ferrying arms to Cuba, battling communists in Africa and even trying to establish new slave states in Central America. The civil war in Spain just before the start of World War II is the best-known example. More than 3,000 Americans joined what became know as the Lincoln-Washington Battalion, to fight with the elected leftist government against fascist forces. At the time, the United States wanted to avoid war with Europe, and stayed neutral, but the Young Communist League rented billboards to recruit fighters, and members of the establishment held fundraisers to send young men overseas. That effort, now often romanticized as a valiant prelude to the fight against the Nazis, ended badly. The poorly trained and equipped brigades made a disastrous assault of a fortified ridge in 1937 and three-quarters of the men were killed or wounded. Others faced near starvation in captivity. Their leader, a former math professor who was the inspiration for the protagonist in Ernest Hemingways novel ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was later captured and most likely executed. On Thursday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov told the Russian News Agency that foreign fighters would not be considered soldiers, but mercenaries, and would not be protected under humanitarian rules regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. ""At best, they can expect to be prosecuted as criminals,"" Konashenkov said. ""We are urging all foreign citizens who may have plans to go and fight for Kyivs nationalist regime to think a dozen times before getting on the way."" Despite the risks -- both individual and strategic -- the U.S. government has so far been measured in its warnings. Asked during a news conference this past week what he would tell Americans who want to fight in Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken pointed to official statements, first issued weeks ago, imploring U.S. citizens in the country to depart immediately. He said: ""For those who want to help Ukraine and help its people, there are many ways to do that, including by supporting and helping the many NGOs that are working to provide humanitarian assistance; providing resources themselves to groups that are trying to help Ukraine by being advocates for Ukraine and for peaceful resolution to this crisis that was created by Russia."" That has not dissuaded a number of veterans who are all too familiar with the risks of combat. James was a medic who first saw combat when he replaced another medic killed in fighting in Iraq in 2006. He did two more tours, in Iraq and Afghanistan, seeing so much blood and death that 10 years after leaving the military he still attends therapy at a veterans hospital. But this past week, as he watched Russian forces shell cities across Ukraine, he decided that he had to try to go there to help. ""Combat has a cost, thats for sure; you think you can come back from war the same, but you cant,"" James said in a phone interview from his home in Dallas, where he said he was waiting to hear back from Ukrainian officials. ""But I feel obligated. Its the innocent people being attacked -- the kids. Its the kids, man. I just cant stand by."" Chase, a graduate student in Virginia, said that he volunteered to fight the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019 and felt the same urgency for Ukraine, but he warned against simply going to the border without a plan. In Syria, he said he knew well-meaning volunteers who were detained for weeks by local Kurdish authorities because they arrived unannounced. He arranged with Kurdish defense forces before arriving in Syria. There he spent months as a humble foot soldier with little pay and only basic rations. Tactically, as an inexperienced grunt, he said, he was of little value. But to the people of northeastern Syria, he was a powerful symbol that the world was with them. ""I was a sign to them that the world was watching and they mattered,"" he said. A few months into his time in Syria, he was shot in the leg and eventually returned to the United States. He came home and worked for a septic tank company, then got a job writing about used cars. When he saw explosions hitting Ukraine this past week, the part of him that went to war three years ago reawakened. ""Everything here is just kind of empty, and it doesnt seem like Im doing anything important,"" he said in an interview from an extended-stay hotel in Virginia where he is living. ""So I am trying to go. I dont think I have a choice. You have to draw the line.""",https://www.wionews.com/world/i-just-cant-stand-by-american-veterans-join-the-fight-in-ukraine-459403
[],Russia unfolds annexation plan for Ukraine,2022-03-05 00:00:00,"Russia on Tuesday announced plans by separatists in Ukraine to hold referendums paving the way for the formal annexation of swathes of territory after nearly seven months of the war with its neighbour, a former Soviet republic. (Text: Reuters)","What's the significance? If Russia goes ahead with the referendums and joins all four regions to Russia then Ukraine - and potentially its Western backers too - would, from a Russian perspective, be fighting against Russia itself. That would raise the risk of a direct military confrontation between Russia and the NATO military alliance, a scenario that President Joe Biden has said could lead to World War Three, because NATO-members are supplying arms and giving intelligence to Ukraine. As such, a rushed Russian move to formally annex another big chunk of Ukrainian territory would be a major escalation just days after potentially the most significant Russian battlefield defeat of the war in northeastern Ukraine. Russia's nuclear doctrine allows the use of such weapons if it is attacked with nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons. While escalating the stakes of the confrontation, Putin could also announce additional steps. Russian stocks plunged to their lowest in a month on Tuesday as Moscow reignited martial law fears with new legislation that tightened penalties for military personnel. Unless Ukraine agreed to stop fighting for its lost territory, then Russia would have to commit significant military forces to defend the newly annexed regions - which are still not fully under Russian control. ""Putin has made a bet on escalation,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R.Politik. ""All this talk about immediate referendums is an absolutely unequivocal ultimatum from Russia to Ukraine and the West.""

[],Putin is in trouble,2022-09-25 17:09:58,"In the wake of a stunning counteroffensive in which Ukrainian forces reclaimed thousands of square miles of territory, Russia is uneasy.","In the wake of a stunning counteroffensive in which Ukrainian forces reclaimed thousands of square miles of territory, Russia is uneasy. The countrys political talk shows, usually so deferential, have given the floor to more critical voices. Opponents of the war have weighed in -- about 40 officials from municipal councils signed a petition requesting the presidents resignation -- and previously loyal figures have begun to mutter about the regimes failings. In a sign of general discontent, Alla Pugacheva, Russias most famous 20th-century pop star, has come out against the war. Six months of consensus has started to crack. That consensus wasnt as cast-iron as it might have seemed. While many Western observers tend to view the Russian regime as a monolith, the reality is more complex. Though the war has significantly reduced the scope for dissent, there are still several competing ideological camps within the ruling elite capable of making their voices heard. For example, the so-called systemic liberals, mostly concentrated in state financial institutions and among oligarchs, have expressed concerns about the wars consequences for the Russian economy. But it is another group, emboldened by the Kremlins failure to deliver victory in Ukraine, that is putting ever more pressure on the regime. Watch | I avoid answering your question: Sergey Lavrov on question of Chinese pressure to end war Call it the party of war. Made up of the security agencies, the Defense Ministry and outspoken media and political figures, it encompasses the entire radical nationalist ecosystem -- and its adherents have been mounting a sustained critique of the Kremlins handling of the war in Ukraine. Powerful, well positioned and ideologically committed, they want a much more aggressive war effort. And judging from Mr. Putins address on Wednesday -- where he announced the call-up of roughly 300,000 troops, gave his support to referendums in the four occupied regions of Ukraine on joining Russia and repeated the threat of nuclear escalation -- they seem to be getting their way. Also Read | A cornered Putin is more dangerous than ever The party of war has been very vocal since April, when it became clear that the Russian Army was unable to conquer Kyiv and overthrow the Zelensky government. Moscows more modest goal -- conquering the Donbas and securing a land bridge to annexed Crimea -- appeared to be an intolerable retrenchment. Throughout, Russias hawks have benefited from an unexpected sounding board: the many Telegram channels, some of which have up to one million followers, run by war journalists embedded with the Russian Army. In a stream of constant commentary, the channels criticize the governments indecisiveness and call for a full-scale conquest of Ukraine and the mass mobilization of the Russian population. Also Read | Will Ukrainian battlefield successes kill nuclear deterrence? Through the summer, the level of criticism was manageable for the regime. But things began to change in August, when Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russias best-known imperial ideologists, Alexander Dugin, was assassinated in Moscow. The perpetrators and purpose of the attack are unknown. But the effect was clear. By bringing the conflict into one of the capitals fanciest neighborhoods, the murder confirmed the hawks dim view of the war effort. Since Ms. Duginas death, the party of war has been using her ""martyrdom"" to renew calls for a full-scale war in overtly eschatological tones. The military reversal of recent weeks has played into their hands. The infamous Chechen head of state, Ramzan Kadyrov, has called for ""self-mobilization,"" inviting regional elites to recruit at least 1,000 citizens each, raising about 85,000 new troops in total. The Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, another key figure on the nationalist right, called for a ""maximum mobilization of forces and resources"" and for the Kremlin to refer to the conflict as a war, rather than a ""special operation."" And Yevgeny Prigozhin, the de facto head of a shadowy mercenary outfit known as the Wagner Group, has been recruiting prisoners to be sent to the front. Their criticism has clearly cut through. While stopping short of mass conscription, Mr. Putins ""partial mobilization,"" as he put it, of some 300,000 troops is a major boost for the party of war. Likewise, plans to hold referendums in Ukraines occupied territories -- Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, Kherson and Zaporizka in the south -- are designed to redraw the terms of the conflict, in ways congenial to the presidents hawkish critics. There are signs too that Mr. Putin may escalate domestically, turning even more to repression. The administration, for example, is stepping up indoctrination for schoolchildren and has instituted new restrictions on supposedly pernicious content in art. The security services, for their part, are laser-focused on stamping out dissent, arresting and jailing any form of opposition. In universities, students and professors are under growing pressure to cut links with their Western counterparts. Already extensive, these efforts could be pursued yet more doggedly, dragging many more Russians into the dragnet. Such an approach is not without its risks. Among citizens, interest in the war and the accompanying rally-around-the-flag effect are waning. More intense repression coupled with an encroaching sense of the wars human costs, as more of the countrys men are drawn into service, could turn them off it entirely. Young and educated Russians may leave the country in greater numbers than they already have. Theres also no assurance that hard-liners in the ruling elite will accept domestic repression as a substitute for military success abroad -- or that the influx of troops will substantially alter the dynamics on the battlefield. With an overdrawn and exhausted army, Mr. Putin must still find a way to deliver a military result that can be framed as at least a partial victory. It doesnt help that the countrys major backers, China and India, have begun to voice concerns. Even amid such difficulties, it would be a mistake to foresee a collapse of the regime, ensconced for two decades. But Mr. Putin, like any leader, depends on legitimacy to ensure his rule.

['Pjotr Sauer'],'He joined the enemy': a Ukraine soldier on fighting his father on Russian side,2022-10-14 09:13:43,"Artur is in touch by text with father Oleg, a colonel in pro-Moscow forces, and is trying hard not to let hate consume him","In the early hours of 24 February, when Russian rockets started to pound Ukraine, unleashing the biggest attack on a European state since the second world war, Artur, like millions of Ukrainians, grabbed his phone to contact his family. But while most young Ukrainians were concerned for the safety of their parents, Artur, 27, had a different message for his father, Oleg, a colonel in the pro-Moscow separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. ""You assholes,"" the text to his father read. ""Dont pick up a gun. Kyiv will fall immediately,"" Oleg replied after some time. Artur did not follow his fathers advice and quickly enlisted as a volunteer, taking part in Ukraines successful defence of the capital, which ended with the withdrawal of Russian forces from the region in April. He soon enrolled in the regular Ukrainian army and most recently took part in its counter-offensive in the north and east of Ukraine. In photographs reviewed by the Guardian, Artur is seen entering Izium and Lyman, two strategically key cities liberated by Ukraine over the last month. Artur in the city of Izium. Photograph: Libkos All this time, he has kept in touch with his father in Russian-occupied Donetsk through text messages that he has shared with the Guardian. ""We are literally on the opposite sides of the frontline. But only one of us is fighting for the right cause,"" said Artur in a video call from Zakarpattia oblast, the westernmost region of Ukraine, where he was recuperating after months of gruesome fighting. Russias invasion of Ukraine has ripped thousands of families apart. Because of the two countries intertwined and complex past, many Ukrainians have relatives on the other side of the border. Shortly after the invasion began, reports emerged of some Ukrainians Russian relatives refusing to believe that Vladimir Putins army was bombing civilians in cities across the country. But few stories encapsulate the family divide as dramatically as Arturs, the first known account of a Ukrainian soldier whose father is fighting as part of the Russian forces. Artur was born into a military family in Boryspil, a city near Kyiv. His father, Oleg, came from the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk region and served a decade in the Ukrainian army until 2011. After divorcing Arturs mother that year, Oleg moved to Russia in search of work, according to his son. Struggling for money, Oleg joined the Donetsk pro-Russian separatist forces in 2016, two years after Moscow annexed Crimea and Putin sent his forces to prop up the separatists in eastern Ukraine. ""I was shocked when he told me he was joining the Donetsk militia,"" Artur recalled. ""For me, like for many Ukrainians, this war started in 2014, and that meant he joined the enemy."" Artur said he had seen his father gradually adopt a pro-Russian stance in the conflict even before he joined the separatists. ""Russian propaganda was taking hold of him. I thought he wouldnt succumb to it, that he would be smarter than that. But I was wrong."" Artur with his fellow soldiers in Izium. Photograph: Libkos The two nevertheless kept in touch when Artur, after studying engineering, followed his long-term dream to pursue a career in the film industry in Kyiv. But as tensions between Russia and Ukraine grew in the run-up to the February 2022 invasion, so did the distance between father and son. In early March, after most Russian troops had been repelled from Kyiv, Artur sent a short video message to his father, mocking him for his earlier warning about the fall of the capital. ""I am walking around but cant see a single Russian. They seem to have disappeared. Can you please advise, I dont understand where they are?"" he said in the video. Oleg replied that Russias fortunes would soon change, once again urging his son to drop his weapons. ""At that point, I already saw that his hopes of a Russian victory were dwindling. He started to become more desperate as Ukraine was gaining more ground."" They talked again after evidence of Russian killings of civilians emerged from the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Oleg said the reports were ""fake"", parroting Russian television claims that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged and that the civilians had been killed by Ukrainians themselves. ""I told him that I was in Bucha myself, that I had seen everything with my own eyes,"" Artur said. ""But, I realised he was hopeless. I stopped trying to convince him of anything. It is wasted energy.""

One of the last times the two were in touch was when Arturs unit helped liberate Izium at the start of Ukraines lightning counter-offensive in the north-east of the country. ""Rejoice while you can,"" the father texted. Artur greets some cats in the city of Izium, eastern Ukraine. Photograph: Libkos ""You are like the bad guys in horror movies. When evil gets beaten, it always promises to return,"" the son replied. A silence ensued when Artur was asked by the Guardian what he would do if he faced his father on the battlefield. ""I dont think I could shoot him or that he could shoot me. Who could kill his own father?"" he said, adding that, for now, the grim prospect was unlikely to materialise as his father was stationed at a military base in Donetsk. In one recent message to Artur, his father said: ""You are still my son. I want the best for you. For you to be happy and healthy."" ""But I think he should face some punishment for all of this in court,"" said Artur. ""I would like to see him witness our victory and his world crumble."" Despite everything, Artur said he had worked hard not to let anger and hate consume him. ""My father betrayed our family, and he betrayed our country. But I am fighting out of a place of love for my country. ""Blind hate would eat me alive, and I would just burn out before this war ended,"" he said, adding that after the war he wanted to return to making movies and help soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. Arturs story was first told in late September by Help Desk, a Russian journalism startup and support chat for those affected by the war. He said he decided to share his story because he realised many Ukrainians were struggling with similar family issues. ""I wanted to get the message across that you are not responsible for the choices of your family. It doesnt make you less of a patriot if your father is a criminal."" His unit was aware of his family history, Artur said, but never questioned his loyalty. ""They know I am 100% committed to Ukraine.""",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/14/ukraine-soldier-confronts-father-fighting-russia-putin

Updated at 10.47 EDT 6h ago 10.19 EDT Heres a summary of key points from Vladimir Putins press conference (see also 2.13pm) from Reuters: ON UKRAINE Of course, partners are concerned about future developments in Russian-Ukrainian relations. It is true that there is nothing unexpected here. I keep our partners informed, tell them our point of view. But this does not affect the character, the quality, or the depth of Russias relations with these countries. India and China always talk about the need to establish dialogue and resolve everything peacefully, we know their position. These are our close allies, partners, and we respect their position. But we also know the position of Kyiv - they keep saying that they want negotiations and it seems like they asked for it, and now they have made an official decision that prohibits negotiations. Right now there is no need for massive strikes [on Ukraine]. For now there are other tasks, because, I believe, out of 29 targets, [only] 7 were not hit as the ministry of defence planned, but they are getting to them gradually. There is no need for massive strikes, in any case case not for now. In future, well see. ON POTENTIAL FOR CLASHES WITH NATO The introduction of troops into a direct confrontation with the Russian army is a very dangerous step that could lead to a global catastrophe. I hope that those who speak of this have enough sense not to take such steps. ON WHETHER HE REGRETS ANYTHING No. I want to make it clear: what is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly, but we would have got the same thing a little later, only in worse conditions for us, thats that. So we are acting correctly and in a timely manner. RUSSIAS MOBILISATION The ministry of defence initially assumed a smaller figure, not 300,000. Nothing extra is planned. No proposals have been received from the ministry of defence in this regard. And in the foreseeable future, this is not necessary. GERMANY [Germany] must decide what is more important for them: the fulfilment of alliance obligations, as they see it, or their national interests. In this case, it seems that Germany placed its obligations to the [Nato] alliance above all. I believe that this is a mistake. German citizens, businesses, and its economy are paying for this mistake, because it has negative economic consequences for the eurozone as a whole, and in Germany. But very few people take into account its interests, otherwise Nord Stream 1 and 2 would not have been undermined. But although one branch remains, as I said, in working order, a decision has not been made and is unlikely to be made. But this is no longer our business, this is the business of our partners. TURKEY Erdogan played a significant role in resolving a number of issues. This is due to the prisoner exchanges, he was personally involved in this work. And, as we see, there have been results. So we are also grateful to him for this, because we got our military personnel and officers back. TALKS WITH THE US I dont see the need for a platform for negotiations [with Biden]. The question of my trip [to the G20 summit] has not yet been finally resolved. Russia will certainly take part in this work, in what format, we will think about that. Updated at 10.48 EDT 7h ago 09.31 EDT European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday will not take any decisions on additional Iran sanctions linked to a transfer of drones from Tehran to Moscow, Reuters report a senior EU official said today.

Updated at 09.56 EDT 7h ago 09.20 EDT Dan Sabbagh My colleague Dan Sabbagh has been attending a background briefing on the situation in Ukraine from western officials, and he reports: The Russian position around Kherson ""is extremely fragile"" with ""a significant force on the wrong side of the Dnipro River"". Asked could the city fall in a week, the officials said ""It is conceivable that something happens within a week, but its also perfectly conceivable that it doesnt."" The officials said Russia is ""rapidly exhausting its supply of long range, precision munitions"", and in particular, air launched cruise missiles. Russia cannot sustain attacks like Mondays. The officials roughly endorsed Ukraines estimate that Russia has used two-thirds of its ""high-precision"" stock. The officials continued by saying that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia ""would break a taboo that has held since 1945"", and would lead to ""severe consequences"" for Moscow. The consequences were not spelled out though, leaving a deliberate ambiguity. On the Nord Stream explosions, the officials said ""It is our assessment that it is almost certainly sabotage"" but they were still not in a position to attribute responsibility to Russia or anybody else. There was concern that the Ukrainians ""wont be able to maintain their offensive indefinitely,"" and that there will come a point later this year when the weather changes, and ""a new phase of the conflict"" begins. ""But for the time being, Ukrainians retain the initiative and momentum.""",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-kherson-evacuees-to-start-arriving-in-russia-ukraine-says-600-settlements-liberated-this-month

Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed: The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be ""annihilated"" by the wests military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: ""Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated."" The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg , also said Russia faced ""severe consequences"" if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine. After retreating about 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove , according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russias flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraines southern Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo , has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from Kherson . The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: ""The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary."" Ukraine s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv . Ukraine s power grid has been ""stabilised"" after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyivs forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak , a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyivs military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraines second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border ""but something went wrong"". Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany , Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,"" the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan , did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The U N general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russias annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution ""condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine"" and ""the attempted illegal annexation"" announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russias foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov , told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy , said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace , said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Updated at 14.12 EDT 1d ago 13.10 EDT Daniel Boffey Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv: Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. ""The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,"" Khusnullin said.

We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary. As we reported earlier Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, posted a video on Telegram urging people to leave the region due to missile attacks. He directly addressed Russian authorities and asked them to ""help organise this work."" The plea is a possible sign that Ukraines counteroffensive is continuing to make inroads in the south of the country. It comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in Kherson.

For now there are other tasks, because, I believe, out of 29 targets, [only] 7 were not hit as the ministry of defence planned, but they are getting to them gradually. There is no need for massive strikes, in any case case not for now. In future, well see. ON POTENTIAL FOR CLASHES WITH NATO The introduction of troops into a direct confrontation with the Russian army is a very dangerous step that could lead to a global catastrophe. I hope that those who speak of this have enough sense not to take such steps. ON WHETHER HE REGRETS ANYTHING No. I want to make it clear: what is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly, but we would have got the same thing a little later, only in worse conditions for us, thats that. So we are acting correctly and in a timely manner. RUSSIAS MOBILISATION The ministry of defence initially assumed a smaller figure, not 300,000. Nothing extra is planned. No proposals have been received from the ministry of defence in this regard. And in the foreseeable future, this is not necessary. GERMANY [Germany] must decide what is more important for them: the fulfilment of alliance obligations, as they see it, or their national interests. In this case, it seems that Germany placed its obligations to the [Nato] alliance above all. I believe that this is a mistake. German citizens, businesses, and its economy are paying for this mistake, because it has negative economic consequences for the eurozone as a whole, and in Germany. But very few people take into account its interests, otherwise Nord Stream 1 and 2 would not have been undermined. But although one branch remains, as I said, in working order, a decision has not been made and is unlikely to be made. But this is no longer our business, this is the business of our partners. TURKEY Erdogan played a significant role in resolving a number of issues. This is due to the prisoner exchanges, he was personally involved in this work. And, as we see, there have been results. So we are also grateful to him for this, because we got our military personnel and officers back. TALKS WITH THE US I dont see the need for a platform for negotiations [with Biden]. The question of my trip [to the G20 summit] has not yet been finally resolved. Russia will certainly take part in this work, in what format, we will think about that. Updated at 10.48 EDT 6h ago 09.31 EDT European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday will not take any decisions on additional Iran sanctions linked to a transfer of drones from Tehran to Moscow, Reuters report a senior EU official said today. The EU was still trying to find independent evidence for the use of Iranian drones by Russia in Ukraine, the official added. Updated at 09.56 EDT 7h ago 09.20 EDT Dan Sabbagh My colleague Dan Sabbagh has been attending a background briefing on the situation in Ukraine from western officials, and he reports: The Russian position around Kherson ""is extremely fragile"" with ""a significant force on the wrong side of the Dnipro River"". Asked could the city fall in a week, the officials said ""It is conceivable that something happens within a week, but its also perfectly conceivable that it doesnt."" The officials said Russia is ""rapidly exhausting its supply of long range, precision munitions"", and in particular, air launched cruise missiles. Russia cannot sustain attacks like Mondays. The officials roughly endorsed Ukraines estimate that Russia has used two-thirds of its ""high-precision"" stock. The officials continued by saying that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia ""would break a taboo that has held since 1945"", and would lead to ""severe consequences"" for Moscow. The consequences were not spelled out though, leaving a deliberate ambiguity. On the Nord Stream explosions, the officials said ""It is our assessment that it is almost certainly sabotage"" but they were still not in a position to attribute responsibility to Russia or anybody else. There was concern that the Ukrainians ""wont be able to maintain their offensive indefinitely,"" and that there will come a point later this year when the weather changes, and ""a new phase of the conflict"" begins. ""But for the time being, Ukrainians retain the initiative and momentum.""",http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/ukraine-live/latest

Some $15m (PS9.8m) in winter clothing and $15.2m (PS9.9m) in howitzer ammunition make up the bulk of the latest military assistance package, Anand announced as she sat down with her Nato counterparts in Brussels. Canada also will provide another $15.3m (PS10m) worth of the high-tech cameras the Ukrainians have been using on their drones, along with more satellite communication services.

The US secretary of defense Lloyd J. Austin III, next to his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, right, and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley. Photograph: Olivier Matthys/AP The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, opened the gathering by condemning the Russian president, Vladimir Putins, deadly missile attacks against ""targets with no military purpose"". Sitting beside his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, Austin said: The whole world has just seen yet again the malice and cruelty of Putins war of choice, rooted in aggression and waged with deep contempt for the rules of war. But Russias latest assaults have only deepened the determination of the Ukrainian people and further united countries of goodwill from every region on Earth. Updated at 13.21 EDT 2d ago 12.31 EDT More than 90,000 Russian fighters have been listed as ""irrecoverable"" military losses since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the Russian media project iStories. ""Irrecoverable losses"" is a category that includes servicemen who were killed, went missing, died from their wounds or were disabled and cannot return to military service. The figure is close to US and UK estimates. In August, Britains defence minister, Ben Wallace, said the Russian armys total losses, including deaths, injuries, and desertions, exceeded 80,000. Updated at 12.33 EDT 2d ago 12.14 EDT Heres more from Gazproms chief, Alexei Miller, who has warned that ""whole towns"" in Europe could freeze this winter despite the continent having almost filled its gas storage facilities. Speaking at the Russia Energy Week conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, Miller said: Winter can be relatively warm, but one week or even five days will be abnormally cold and its possible that whole towns and lands, god forbid, will freeze. During days of peak winter demand, Europe could lack some 800m cubic metres of natural gas per day, or one third of its total consumption, Miller said. European gas inventories are currently about 91% full, with the most pessimistic estimates suggesting they will be at 5% capacity in March, he added. 2d ago 11.55 EDT US president Joe Biden has said he has not seen any movement from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the release of the American basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, was sentenced to nine years in prison in August after Russian police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow in February. On Monday, Griners defence team appealed against her conviction for narcotics possession and trafficking. The US has said she was wrongfully detained and has offered to exchange her for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year prison sentence in America. Asked if he had seen any action on Griners case, Biden replied: Not from Putin. During his interview with CNN on Tuesday, Biden said he would be willing to meet Putin at the G20 meeting next month if the Russian leader wanted to discuss the detained WNBA star. He said: I have no intention of meeting with him. But for example, if he came to me at the G20 and said I want to talk about the release of Griner, Id meet with him. I mean, it would depend. 00:29 Putin 'totally miscalculated Russias ability to occupy Ukraine, Biden says - video Updated at 12.18 EDT 2d ago 11.46 EDT The head of the UNs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has tweeted a photo of himself returning to Kyiv after meeting with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday.

The Russian leader also told Grossi that Moscow was open for dialogue and would discuss ""all issues"" concerning the facilitys operations. 2d ago 11.36 EDT Russian authorities are mobilising men from the countrys most vulnerable groups to fight in Ukraine, according to a report. Officials in Moscow have taken men from charity centres for the homeless and needy, as well as hostels where labour migrants live, the Moscow Times has cited a report by the independent Mediazona news website. Dozens of homeless men have been taken off the streets and brought to military enlistment offices in the weeks since President Vladimir Putin declared a ""partial"" mobilisation, according to a group that hands out food to the capitals homeless community. One source told Mediazona: The police come here without anyone asking. They see a queue of people waiting for food -- and then they grab them by the scruff of the neck, against their will. The men are then loaded onto buses and transported to military enlistment offices, the source said. 2d ago 11.22 EDT Ukrainians urged to cut power consumption by 25% to avoid outages Ukraines prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. People are being asked to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm across Ukraine by 25% in order to stabilise the power system, which had been damaged by Russian missile attacks. In a statement, Shmyhal said: We are grateful to all Ukrainians who deliberately reduced electricity consumption yesterday and the night before yesterday. The total saving was 10%. We also thank the heads of regions, heads of communities, who took a responsible approach and cut power consumption in communities. He also appealed to people to use gas and coal sparingly after turning on the heating: The minimum permissible indoor temperature this winter will be 16 degrees Celsius, while the average temperature will be 18 degrees. This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter."" 2d ago 10.24 EDT Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior Nato official. Reuters quotes the official as saying that Moscows industry cannot produce all kinds of ammunition and weapon systems due to western sanctions. 2d ago 10.17 EDT Putin-Erdogan talks will be 'very interesting', says Kremlin President Vladimir Putin will meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in what is likely to be a ""very interesting"" meeting in Kazakhstan tomorrow, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Speaking to reporters, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said: Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdogan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us. The Russian and Turkish presidents are expected to meet in Kazakhstans capital tomorrow on the sidelines of a regional summit. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has previously said the potential talks between Russia and the west could be discussed during the meeting. Updated at 10.43 EDT 2d ago 09.25 EDT The Netherlands will deliver EUR15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Reuters reports the the defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament: ""These attacks ... can only be met with unrelenting support for Ukraine and its people."" Updated at 09.35 EDT 2d ago 09.16 EDT Vatican official: Russian bombing of Ukrainian cities 'to be totally condemned' Earlier we reported that Pope Francis had condemned the recent wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities, saying: ""My heart is always with the Ukrainian people, especially the residents of the places that have been hit by relentless bombings. May the Lords spirit transform the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that the hurricane of violence stops and peaceful coexistence in justice can be rebuilt."" Reuters has now reported an additional quote from the Vatican number two, secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Asked if the attacks could be considered war crimes, he said he was not qualified to make such a technical, juridical judgment. ""But certainly they are unacceptable acts that cry out vengeance before God and before humanity, because bombing unarmed civilians is beyond any logic. It is to be totally condemned,"" Parolin said.

['Helen Sullivan'],What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,2022-10-14 18:00:43,Kerch bridge attacked; Russia launches strikes across Ukraine; winter weaponised,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Kerch bridge explosion Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer wrote about the explosion on Kerch Bridge, which, before Russias invasion was used by 15,000 cars a day. ""Long threatened, the hated $4bn Russian symbol of Moscows occupation of Crimea - one that Russia had boasted was impossible to attack - had been blown up"", they wrote. ""The symbolism of the moment - a day after Russian president Vladimir Putins 70th birthday and just over a week after he announced the illegal annexation of four more Ukrainian territories amid huge pomp in Moscow - was lost on nobody."" Putin called the attack on the bridge an ""act of terrorism"" and retaliated with strikes on civilian targets in towns and cities across Ukraine in the days that followed. People take selfies in front of artwork of a stamp showing explosions on the Kerch Bridge on 11 October 2022 in Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Ed Ram/Getty Images Russia targets Kyiv and other cities in strikes Peter Beaumont, Charlotte Higgins and Artem Mazhulin covered the attacks launched on Monday morning on civilian targets in cities across Ukraine, including Kyiv, during which cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 100. ""Watching the clean-up in Shevchenko Park, which was already under way early on Monday afternoon, was Tetiana Kononir, who lives nearby. 'I dont know whats in his head, whats in his heart, she said. 'This only unites us even more. He will never defeat us. He will never put us on our knees."" In their analysis of Putins attacks, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote that the Russian presidents mass strikes were ""a desperate answer to his militarys critics at home, to the fact that Russias invasion is failing, and to his own wounded pride after the Crimean Bridge, a pet project, was rocked by an explosion."" Pjotr also profiled Sergei Surovikin, the new unified Russian battlefield commander in Ukraine, who has a ruthless reputation. Relatives and servicemen attend the funeral service for Edisher Kvaratskhelia, a Georgian volunteer who died in combat on 13 October 2022 amid Russias attacks on the city. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images How likely is nuclear Armageddon? Julian Borger took a level-headed look at the prospect of Putin choosing the nuclear option, as Joe Biden warned of the greatest threat since the Cuban missile crisis six decades ago. ""Even if he did issue the launch order, he has no guarantee it would be carried out,"" Borger wrote. And Putin is unlikely to issue the order if his primary goal is to remain in power, which it appears to be. ""Nor can he be absolutely sure that the weapons and their delivery systems would work."" Later in the week, Biden released a new national security strategy (NSS) which, as Julian Borger wrote, warned that the US would need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers within the decade, pointing to Russias arsenal, as well as an expanding Chinese stockpile. The blueprint warns that, ""Russias conventional military will have been weakened, which will probably increase Moscows reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning."" In a foreword, Biden makes a distinction between the types of threats posed by Moscow and Beijing, writing, ""Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown."" He describes China as ""the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective"". The G7 held crisis talks with Zelenskiy During crisis talks, Zelenskiy asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. His request for monitoring came amid mounting fears that Minsk is being drawn ever further into the Kremlins war, Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger reported. Andrew Roth and Daniel Boffey looked into the likelihood of Belarusian President, Aleksandr Lukashenko, entering a war that, at the moment, Russia is losing. Lukashenko has said that Belarus and Russia will deploy a joint military group, and that thousands of Russian troops will be arriving in his country in the coming days for drills. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy joins a video conference with leaders of the Group of Seven as part crisis talks, on 11 October 2022. Photograph: Presidential Press Service/EPA In response to Zelenskiys speech at the meeting, G7 leaders issued a statement saying they would ""stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes"". But, Patrick Wintour wrote, the leaders sidestepped imposing a price cap on Russian oil - the countrys largest source of income, and best way to fund its war in Ukraine. ""The latest G7 statement made only the most passing general comment about 'continuing to cooperate to ensure energy security and affordability across the G7 and beyond,"" Wintour reported. Zelenskiy had urged the meeting to impose a tough price cap, calling for ""zero profit for the terrorist state"". Putin weaponises the cold Winter is closing in on Ukraine and with it ""perhaps the worst-ever period for our country"", Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv said, as he addressed local and international journalists in a building off the western Ukrainian citys cobbled Rynov Square. Daniel Boffey was there and wrote about Putins efforts to weaponise winter -including by launching missile strikes on energy infrastructure. Boffey reported that the ""draughty state of the regions 6,000 bomb shelters has been raised as a particular concern"", with Sadovyi urging residents to make sure that shelters had heaters and firewood. ""It will save us from freezing. Any repairs [to the electricity grid] will need a day or two or three and we need to survive in the meantime. We need to survive the weapon of the enemy: which is cold, fear and destruction.""

Photograph: Yuriy Dyachyshyn/AFP/Getty Images Russia evacuates Kherson, stoking fears city will become new frontline After an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the Kherson region, Moscow announced it would evacuate Kherson city, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the southern Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline in the war. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in southern Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. Map showing location of Kherson Map showing location of Kherson Daniel Boffey covered the news, writing that officials in Kyiv have spoken of their hopes of reaching the regional capital of Kherson by Christmas, despite Putins recent announcement that the oblast had been ""annexed"" into Russia alongside Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk. On Wednesday, Ukraine boasted gains near the city, claiming that five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region - Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone - had been taken from Russian forces over the course of the day. Saudi Arabia decides to cut oil production, angering US 01:45 Democrat senators call for a freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia amid oil production cuts - video The relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia continued to deteriorate on Thursday as the two countries traded barbs over the decision to cut oil production, with Washington accusing Riyadh of coercing other members of the Opec+ cartel, and Riyadh suggesting the Biden administration tried to get the decision delayed by a month. Archie Bland looked at why the US was so upset by the decision, writing, ""When Joe Biden gave Saudi Arabias de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, a fist bump in Jeddah in July, it was viewed as a moment of excruciating realpolitik: Biden, who had vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state over the assassination of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was instead palling around with the man believed to have ordered the hit. Today, that gambit appears to have failed - and the relationship is in tatters."" Bland also looks at why Prince Mohammed would risk one of Riyadhs most crucial alliances to help the beleaguered Russian regime - and what the news will mean for oil prices and Russias ability to prosecute the war.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/15/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis

He added: ""This [has happened] in Kherson region, Kharkiv region, Luhansk region and Donetsk region ... In particular, according to the military reports from the Kherson region: the settlements of Lyubimivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Bilyaivka, Ukrainka, Velyka and Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davidiv Brid were liberated from the occupier and stabilised."" Zelenskiy noted that the list of released territories is not complete, vowing to continue fighting against Russian forces: ""And this is far from a complete list. Our soldiers do not stop.

Updated at 16.32 EDT 4 Oct 2022 16.57 EDT Ukraines foreign minister, who is in Senegal this week, promised that his country will do all it can to send more grain to Africa, which is facing a food crisis in the wake of the war, the AP reported. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba met with Senegals president, Macky Sall, who is also the chair of the African Union. At a joint press conference, Kuleba said Ukraine would be sending ""boats full of seeds for Africa"", adding, ""We will do our best until the last breath to continue exporting Ukrainian grain to Africa and the world for food security."" Prior to the war, African countries relied on Ukraine and Russia for 44% of their wheat and Ukraine grew enough food for 400m people. Russia has sought to place the blame shortages and rising food prices on western sanctions. 4 Oct 2022 16.42 EDT Ukraine may restart the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europes largest nuclear plant, to ensure its safety, the president of the company that operates the plant told the Associated Press today. The potential restart comes weeks after there were escalating fears of a radiation disaster at the Russian-occupied facility.

Our @AP interview with @h_arhirova https://t.co/v9Ox9zJfNK -- Adam Schreck (@adamschreck) October 4, 2022 Energoatom, the Ukranian state nuclear company, shut down the plants six remaining reactors on 11 September amid fighting in the area. Russian military activity had cut off power supplies for safety systems, raising fears of a meltdown, the AP noted. But Energoatom president Petro Kotin told the AP today that the company may restart two of the reactors in the coming days to ""protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop"". Kotin said: If you have low temperature, you will just freeze everything inside. The safety equipment will be damaged. So you need heating and the only heating is going to come from the working reactor."" Even with the reactors shut down, damage to the systems or failures due to cold weather could still lead to catastrophe, the companys president said, adding, ""You have residual heat and you should constantly provide the coolant for these fuel assemblies. If you stop cooling, then you will have meltdown. And that is how it works ... We, at the moment, are evaluating all the risks. And this depends on the weather. And actually, we dont have much time to do that."" 4 Oct 2022 16.19 EDT Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked US president Joe Biden for his ""continued defence and financial support"" in a phone call today, AFP reports. Zelenskiy said in a statement that the two sides discussed ""additional sanctions (and) the situation on the battlefield"". The White House announced earlier today that it would be providing $625m (PS544m) in new military aid, which would include High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) launchers. Zelenskiy wrote: I am grateful to the President of the United States and the entire American people for the continued defence and financial support ... I was pleased to hear the words of President Biden that our servicemen inspire the whole world, our people inspire the whole world."" Ukraine already has access to 16 of the Himars systems, AFP noted, adding that the US state department has confirmed that the US has now sent more than $16.8 billion in aid since the invasion began.

She should be released immediately,"" said the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, during a briefing today, reported AFP. The White house said today that it has offered to swap Viktor Bout, the jailed arms dealer, for Griner and Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who has been incarcerated in Russia since 2018. Jean-Pierre told reporters that the US has yet to receive a serious response from Russia. ""We need to see a serious counter-offer,"" said Jean-Pierre. Griner has been incarcerated in Russia since February and was sentenced to nine years in Russian prison. The court date to appeal her sentence is set for 25 October. Updated at 15.51 EDT 4 Oct 2022 14.45 EDT The United States said today that there is no indication Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons, Reuters reported, despite posturing from Vladimir Putin. White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said during a briefing that despite ""nuclear saber rattling"", there are no signs that the Russia is planning to actually use such weapons. ""We take any nuclear weapons or nuclear saber rattling very seriously here, but I do want to say ... that we have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture, nor do we have any indication that Russia is preparing to imminently use nuclear weapons,"" Jean-Pierre said. Putin has escalated the more than seven month war in Ukraine with a military mobilisation and warnings of nuclear weapons use. Updated at 14.57 EDT 4 Oct 2022 14.23 EDT Ukraines economy is set to contract by 35%, the World Bank reported on Tuesday, as the country deals with Russias ongoing invasion. The international financial institution described Ukraines economy as ""scarred by the destruction of productive capacity, damage to agricultural land, and reduced labor supply"" in an economic update for Europe and Central Asia, reported AFP. The World Bank also estimated that upwards of 14 million people have been displaced by the war, with recovery and rebuilding efforts billed at $349bn, 1.5 times the size of Ukraines pre-war economy. The US gave Ukraine an additional $12.3bn in aid last week to help the war-torn country in its fight against Russia, AFP further reported. Updated at 15.49 EDT 4 Oct 2022 14.01 EDT Summary Here is whats happened so far today with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine: The US president, Joe Biden, told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Washington will provide Kyiv with $625m (PS544m) in new security assistance, including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) launchers, the White House said. Russian defence ministry maps appear to show rapid withdrawals of Russian invasion forces from areas in eastern and southern Ukraine where they have been under severe pressure from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro River ""will not be an easy rush into constrained territory"". The European Union has summoned Russias envoy to condemn and reject Moscows ""illegal annexation"" of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, the EU diplomatic service has said. Vladimir Putin is ""likely"" to sign laws to incorporate four Ukrainian territories into Russia during the course of the day, according to the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov.

['Andrew Roth'],Russia appoints notorious general to lead Ukraine offensive,2022-10-08 15:15:20,Sergei Surovikin appointed on same day as explosion on Kerch bridge that has dealt blow to Vladimir Putin,"Russia has appointed a notorious general who opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s as its first overall commander for the war in Ukraine, as the Kremlin struggles to halt a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has left its forces in disarray. The appointment of Gen Sergei Surovikin came on the same day as Vladimir Putin was dealt a humiliating blow after an explosion on the Kerch bridge sank a section of the motorway into the Kerch Strait and caused a major fire on the railway. Surovikin is a veteran commander who led the Russian military expedition in Syria in 2017, where he was accused of using ""controversial"" tactics including indiscriminate bombing against anti-government fighters. 01:36 Kerch bridge blast: CCTV footage appears to show moment of explosion - video His appointment is the first of an overall battlefield commander for Russian troops in Ukraine. It may indicate that Moscow now understands that its military is in danger of collapse in Ukraine, with Kyivs forces advancing in all four of the regions that Putin claims to have ""annexed"". A former head of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Surovikin was installed in the summer as head of the southern military grouping, replacing Gen Alexander Dvornikov, who lasted just months in the position. He is seen as having improved the effectiveness of Russian forces fighting in east Ukraine, where poor communication and cooperation has plagued the Russian invasion force. Yet Surovikin also has a checkered history that includes two stints in jail for allegedly selling weapons and for leading a military column against protesters during the 1991 coup. He has also previously served in Tajikistan and Chechnya. ""For over 30 years, Surovikins career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality,"" wrote British intelligence officials in a recent report on Surovikins likely promotion to lead the southern military group. During the 1991 coup detat attempt launched by Soviet hardliners, Surovikin, then a captain, led a rifle division that drove through barricades erected by pro-democracy protesters. Three men were killed in the clash, including one who was crushed. ""It is highly symbolic that Sergei Surovikin, the only officer who ordered to shoot on revolutionaries in August 1991 and actually killed three people, is now in charge of this last-ditch effort to restore Soviet Union,"" wrote Grigory Yudin, a Russian political scientist and sociologist. ""These people knew what they were doing, and they know now."" With the appointment, the Kremlin may also be seeking to combat criticism from nationalists who have accused the army of mismanaging the war in Ukraine and of failing to use harsh tactics to try to force the Kyiv government to submit. Among Russians who welcomed the appointment of Surovikin was Yevgeny Prigozhin, the notorious founder of the Wagner private military company and a vocal critic of the military leadership. ""Surovikin is the most able commander in the Russian army,"" Prigozhin said, according to a statement put out by Concord, a company he is associated with. He is a ""legendary figure, he was born to serve his motherland faithfully."" ""Having received an order [in 1991], Surovikin was that officer who without hesitation got in his tank and went forward to save his country.""",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/russia-appoints-notorious-general-sergei-surovikin-ukraine

""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" SpaceXs director of government sales wrote, in a letter seen by CNN. In a separate letter reported by CNN, an external consultant working for the company told the Pentagon: ""SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service."" Musk appeared to confirm that report on Friday morning, writing on Twitter that ""nothing was leaked about our competitors in space launch & communications, Lockheed & Boeing, who get over $60B [from the US Department of Defence]"". In another post, he tweeted: ""In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain & replenish satellites & ground stations & pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. Weve also had to defend against cyber-attacks & jamming, which are getting harder. Burn is approaching ~$20M/month."" But the request for funding comes after a high-profile intervention from Musk, who suggested Ukraine should seek an end to the war by surrendering territory to Russia and committing to remain ""neutral"". His tweets led to a furious reaction from the Ukrainian government, which had previously praised Musk for offering the Starlink system. ""Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,"" tweeted Andrij Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. ""The only outcome is that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing Tesla crap. So good luck to you."" In response to a suggestion that Musk was threatening to withdraw Starlink because of Melnyks words, the SpaceX chief executive tweeted this morning that ""were just following his recommendation "". Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Friday that Kyiv would find a solution to keep Starlink working. ""Lets be honest. Like it or not, @elonmusk helped us survive the most critical moments of war,"" Podolyak wrote on Twitter. ""Business has the right to its own strategies. Ukraine will find a solution to keep PSStarlink working. We expect that the company will provide stable connection till the end of negotiations."" Ukrainian forces had already reported problems with Starlink coverage in recent days, after Musks attempted peace process but before the latest reports of a funding gap. Last week, the Financial Times reported a ""catastrophic"" loss of communication occurred as soldiers in the Ukrainian army pushed forward into land previously occupied by Russia, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The terminals, which connect to a fleet of low-earth orbit microsatellites launched by SpaceX in order to provide high-speed internet access across much of the world, have proved crucial to the Ukrainian war effort since they were donated by the company earlier this year. As well as enabling rapid secure communication between troops on the ground and headquarters, the satellites also help the army operate the drones that have proved pivotal in reshaping the rules of the battlefield. On Tuesday, Musk denied a report that he had spoken directly to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Ian Bremmer, the president of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said: ""Elon Musk told me he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. He also told me what the Kremlins red lines were.""

['Edward Helmore'],Petraeus: US would destroy Russia's troops if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine,2022-10-02 18:56:18,Former CIA director and retired army general says Moscows leader is 'desperate and 'battlefield reality he faces is irreversible,"The US and its allies would destroy Russias troops and equipment in Ukraine - as well as sink its Black Sea fleet - if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, uses nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned on Sunday. Petraeus said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow. He told ABC News: ""Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato - a collective - effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea."" The warning comes days after Putin expressed views that many have interpreted as a threat of a larger war between Russia and the west. Asked if the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine would bring America and Nato into the war, Petraeus said that it would not be a situation triggering the alliances Article 5, which calls for a collective defense. That is because Ukraine is not part of Nato - nonetheless, a ""US and Nato response"" would be in order, Petraeus said. Petraeus acknowledged that the likelihood that radiation would extend to Nato countries under the Article 5 umbrella could perhaps be construed as an attack on a Nato member. ""Perhaps you can make that case,"" he said. ""The other case is that this is so horrific that there has to be a response - it cannot go unanswered."" Yet, Petraeus added, ""You dont want to, again, get into a nuclear escalation here. But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way."" Nonetheless, with pressure mounting on Putin after Ukrainian gains in the east of the country under last weeks annexation declaration and resistance to mobilization efforts within Russia mounting, Petraeus said Moscows leader was ""desperate"". ""The battlefield reality he faces is, I think, irreversible,"" he said. ""No amount of shambolic mobilization, which is the only way to describe it; no amount of annexation; no amount of even veiled nuclear threats can actually get him out of this particular situation. ""At some point theres going to have to be recognition of that. At some point theres going to have to be some kind of beginning of negotiations, as [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy has said, will be the ultimate end."" But, Petraeus warned, ""It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia. And even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield wont change this at all."" Still, he added, ""You have to take the threat seriously."" Senator Marco Rubio, the ranking Republican member of the Senate foreign relations committee, told CNN that Putin was down to two choices: established defensive lines or withdraw and lose territory. Rubio said he believed it ""quite possible"" that Putin could strike distribution points where US and allied supplies are entering Ukraine, including inside Poland. The senator acknowledged the nuclear threat, but he said most worries about ""a Russian attack inside Nato territory, for example, aiming at the airport in Poland or some other distribution point"". ""Nato will have to respond to it,"" he said. ""How it will respond, I think a lot of it will depend on the nature of the attack and the scale and scope of it."" But as a senator privy to Pentagon briefings, Rubio resisted being drawn on whether hed seen evidence that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. ""Certainly, the risk is probably higher today than it was a month ago,"" Rubio said, predicting that Russia would probably take an intermediate step. ""He may strike one of these logistical points. And that logistical point may not be inside ... Ukraine. To me, that is the area that I focus on the most, because it has a tactical aspect to it. And I think he probably views it as less escalatory. Nato may not.""",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/us-russia-putin-ukraine-war-david-petraeus

Ukraine's power grid has been ""stabilised"" after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. Ukraine s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy has been rescued after hours under rubble after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv . The Moscow-installed head of Ukraines southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo , has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove , according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russias flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,"" the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russias annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution ""condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine"" and ""the attempted illegal annexation"" announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russias foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine currently only has 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said that Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday.

Putin said during a televised speech at a Kremlin ceremony to annex four Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. ""By organising explosions on the Nord Stream international gas pipelines that run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, they actually started destroying European energy infrastructure,"" Putin said. ""It is clear to everyone who benefits from this,"" Putin added, without providing further details. However, Russias Security Council chief, Nikolai Patrushev, told state TV later on Friday that Russia ""does not have such data"" about the alleged involvement of Western secret services in the Nord Stream blasts. Unexplained gas leaks, preceded by two explosions, occurred on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines on Monday. Both Moscow and Washington denied involvement.

The package, which was approved just hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed four Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions, includes $3 billion for arms, supplies and salaries for Ukraines military and authorizes president Joe Biden to direct the Pentagon to transfer $3.7 billion in weapons and other hardware to Ukraine. The so-called ""continuing resolution"" - passed by 230 votes to 201, with 10 Republicans joining the Democrats - also provides $4.5 billion for Kyiv to keep the countrys finances stable and keep the government running. The allocation brings the total amount of US contribution to $65 billion. ""This new grant assistance is a further demonstration of US confidence in Ukraine and will support critical government operations and provide relief to Ukrainian people suffering under Russias brutal war,"" Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. ""Critically, this funding will also help bolster Ukraines valiant resistance to Putins illegal war of aggression. We call on fellow donors to not only speed up their existing disbursements to Ukraine, but also to increase their scale of assistance."" 30 Sep 2022 14.29 EDT Air alarms have sounded nearly all across Ukraine following Russias illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories and after scores of people were killed on Friday morning after Russian forces attacked a civilian convoy near the city of Zaporizhzhia.

He also said, during remarks at the White House, that ""Putins actions are a sign he is struggling."" Biden said the US will never recognise the annexed territories as being part of Russia. Following Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiys announcement in a video address in Kyiv today that his country was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato alliance, Biden also said the US ""is prepared to defend every inch of Nato territory. Mr Putin, dont misunderstand what Im saying. Every inch."" Biden held the event at the White House to make remarks about the devastating hurricane that has hit Florida, after earlier hitting Cuba and knocking out its electricity, and is now heading straight for South Carolina. He started by saying: ""America and its allies are not going to be intimidated by Putin and his reckless words and threats. Hes not going to scare us or intimidate us. Putins actions are a sign hes struggling, the sham referenda that he carried out and this routine he put on, the sham routine he put on this morning, showing the unity and people holding hands together, well the United States is never going to recognise this and quite frankly the world is not going to recognise it either. ""He cant seize his neighbours territory and get away with it, simple as that. And were going to stay the course, continue to provide military equipment so that Ukraine can defend itself and its territory and its freedom."" He didnt take questions from the press, but instead added specifically at the end of his remarks about Hurricane Ian that he wanted to address the latest turn of events in Ukraine.

For me, two things stood out from Putin's annexation speech. First, the level of anti-Western bile. Second, his comment about the US having set a ""precedent"" by using nuclear weapons against Japan at end of WW2.

""Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Russia! Together for ever!"" read the banner hanging on Manezh Square by the Kremlin. There were busloads of tough men from a factory near Moscow alighting by the statue of Karl Marx to celebrate, university teachers passing out invitations to a pop concert to their students, workers lugging armfuls of Russian flags to distribute. Some of the tricolours bore the image of Putin. This is the Russia that Putin envisions after 22 years in power: united, simple, cynical and slavish. But real life is not a staged rally. And as Putin gathered his lackeys and satraps in the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, across the country, from the minority ethnic republics of Dagestan and Buryatia to the hinterlands of Pskov and Penza, to cosmopolitan Moscow, communities are in turmoil. Hundreds of thousands of men are leaving their homes, some contracted and mobilised into fighting in Ukraine, and still more fleeing for the borders to dodge the draft. In both cases, they do not know when they will come home. Tensions have not been as high as they are now in Russia for decades, according to a new poll from the state-run Public Opinion Foundation. Of those surveyed by the centre this week, 69% said they had felt ""stress"", nearly double the 35% who told the pollster they felt tense before Putin announced his mobilisation. ""I feel we are going into the unknown, going into nowhere,"" said Anton, a Moscow resident who had passed into Georgia after waiting more than three days on the border. He described men desperate to reach the border before Putin spoke on Friday, with fears that the annexations would set off a tit-for-tat response with the west leading to a potential border closure.

German embassies in countries neighbouring Russia have seen a ""sharp increase"" in visa enquiries, the source told Reuters. Der Spiegel previously reported that German missions in Yerevan, Astana, Tbilisi, Baku and Minsk had registered thousands of requests for entry permits to Germany since partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine began. In the Georgian capital Tbilisi, more than 300 visa applications were registered from Russian citizens in the German embassy since partial mobilisation began in the middle of this week, it said. This compares with between 10 and 20 such requests a month over the past few months, it added.

But he reiterated that the US takes Vladimir Putins nuclear sabre-rattling ""very seriously"". Speaking at a press conference in Washington, Blinken said: We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons. To date, weve not seen them take these actions. He continued: But we also know that Russia is engaged in horrific, horrific brutalisation of Ukraine, and so the threats that they make, we take very seriously. Blinken said he would not speculate on what was Putins intent but said the US plans for ""every possible scenario, including this one"". Updated at 13.11 EDT 30 Sep 2022 12.59 EDT Russias latest actions 'most serious escalation since beginning of war, says Nato chief Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of provoking ""the most serious escalation"" of the war in Ukraine since it began with his latest actions. Speaking at a news conference, Stoltenberg said: Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory. Together, this represents the most serious escalation since the start of the war. Russias move was ""the largest attempted annexation of European territory by force since the second world war"", Stoltenberg said, adding that an area roughly the size of Portugal had been ""illegally seized by Russia at gunpoint"". The sham referendums were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine in total violation of international law. This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognise any of this territory as part of Russia. Nato was not a party to the conflict but reaffirmed its ""unwavering support"" for Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said. We call on all states to reject Russias blatant attempts at territorial conquest These lands are Ukraine. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA Updated at 13.12 EDT 30 Sep 2022 12.51 EDT Ukraine is facing significant risks to energy supplies this winter, the director of the EU energy watchdog has warned. Ukraines current power production appears to be sufficient to cover its needs after a drop in industrial activity cut consumption by 30%, Artur Lorkowski, director of the Energy Community Secretariat, said. Lorkowski told Reuters: But I expect the situation may change dramatically, because once the heating season starts consumption will grow. The situation concerning power generation was unclear, he added. Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is currently held by Russia, was cut off from the grid, while some thermal power plants were located in combat areas. If the Zaporizhzhia plant remains offline for longer and other coal-fired power plants are down, Ukraine may need up to two billion bcm of extra gas, he said. Nearly 1.4 million Ukrainians currently do not have access either to electricity or gas, mostly in war-impacted areas in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country, Lorkowski said. Updated at 12.55 EDT 30 Sep 2022 12.45 EDT A defiant Volodymyr Zelenskiy has announced that Ukraine is officially applying for membership of Nato, hours after Vladimir Putin said in a Kremlin ceremony that he was annexing four Ukrainian provinces. In a speech filmed outside his presidential office in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he was taking this ""decisive step"" in order to protect ""the entire community"" of Ukrainians. He promised the application would happen in an ""expedited manner"". ""De facto, we have already made our way to Nato. De facto, we have already proven compatibility with alliance standards. They are real for Ukraine - real on the battlefield and in all aspects of our interaction,"" he said. We trust each other, we help each other, and we protect each other. This is the alliance. De facto. Today, Ukraine is applying to make it de jure. The president signed the application form, as did the speaker of parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, and the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The alliance is unlikely to accept Ukraines imminent Nato entry while it is in a state of war. As a Nato member, fellow members would be compelled to actively defend it against Russia - a commitment that goes well beyond the supply of weapons. Zelenskiy acknowledged this soon after Russias full-scale invasion. ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato, we understand this,"" he said in March. ""For years we heard about the apparently open door, but have already also heard that we will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged.""

He told reporters after attending a summit in Kazakhstan on Friday that a total of 222,000 reservists would be called up, down from the 300,000 figure initially circulated. A total of 33,000 of them were said to be already in military units, and 16,000 are involved in the military operation in Ukraine. Putin also said that any direct clash of Nato troops with Russia would lead to a ""global catastrophe"". ""I hope that those who are saying this are smart enough not to take such steps,"" he said. Asked whether he had any regrets over his actions in Ukraine he said ""no"". Russia announced it will evacuate residents from Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian region will become a new frontline. A Ukrainian member of Khersons regional council has condemned Russias ""evacuation"" of the occupied city, saying it is in fact a ""deportation"".

The UK Ministry of Defence says that ""Russia continues to prosecute offensive operations in central Donbas and is, very slowly, making progress"". The ministry explained that, ""in the last three days, pro-Russian forces have made tactical advances towards the centre of the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast"" and ""likely advanced into the villages of Opytine and Ivangrad to the south of the town."" Ukraines armed forces have liberated more than 600 settlements from the Russian occupation in the past month, including 75 in the highly strategic Kherson region, Ukraines Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporary Occupied Territories claimed late on Thursday. The US and Germany are to deliver sophisticated anti-aircraft systems to Kyiv this month to counter attacks by Russian missiles and kamikaze drones, Ukraines defence minister said. Sweden has rejected plans for a joint investigation with Denmark and Germany of the recent ruptures of Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. German weekly Spiegel, citing German security sources, reported that Sweden has decided not to share findings of its investigation with other states for security reasons. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that two 16-year-old boys were among those injured by Russian shelling in the region in the last 24 hours. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is reporting that people have been killed and there are wounded after an ammunition dump in Oktyabrsky village in the Belgorod region of Russia exploded. Authorities have blamed the explosion on shelling over the border by Ukrainian armed forces. Train operations were also suspended early on Friday near Novyi Oskol, a town in Russias Belgorod region after remains of a missile fell near the railway. Ukraine has accused the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of inaction in upholding the rights of Ukrainian prisoners of war and urged it to undertake a mission to a camp in the Russian-occupied east of the country. The ICRC responded to the criticism by calling for ""immediate and unimpeded access"" to all prisoners of war, saying it was prepared to make the necessary visits, but that ""we cannot access by force a place of detention or internment where we have not been admitted."" The US government has said it can impose sanctions on people, countries and companies that provide ammunition to Russia or support its military industrial complex. Wally Adeyemo, the deputy treasury secretary, said in a meeting of officials from 32 countries that the department will issue guidance to make it clear that Washington is willing and able to impose such a crackdown Elon Musk appears to have confirmed on Twitter that funding for the Space X Starlink satellite internet system in Ukraine is being pulled. The company is asking the US government to step in and foot the bill. The move comes days after Musk faced huge criticism in Ukraine for a Twitter poll he conducted on a peace proposal that appeared to show Musks support for Vladimir Putins military aims in Ukraine. The city of Mykolaiv, 60 miles north-west of Kherson city, was pummelled by Russian missiles on Thursday, with one strike on a five-storey apartment block killing a 31-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman. Five further people were said to still be under rubble. Mykolaiv regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said an 11-year-old boy was pulled from the rubble after six hours and rescue teams were searching for seven more people. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be ""annihilated"" by the wests military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. Instead, Putin courted Erdogan with a plan to pump more Russian gas via Turkey that would turn it into a new supply ""hub"", bidding to preserve Russias energy leverage over Europe. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,"" the foreign ministry said. Russia will run out of supplies and armaments before the west does, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, claimed Thursday. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. Ukrainian officials claimed Iranians in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were training Russians in how to use the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drone, which can conduct air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare and targeting.

Updated at 09.33 EDT 5 Oct 2022 13.06 EDT Summary of the day so far ... The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federations claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that ""dozens"" of towns ha d been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman , the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin , installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia, has said ""the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened"", while Kirill Stremousov , part of the occupation administration imposed on Kherson , has been quoted saying that Russian forces were ""conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow"" in the region, and that ""the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped"". None of the claims could be independently verified. Asked about the proposed borders, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov , said: ""In general, of course, there we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of admission [to Russia]. But I repeat once again: certain territories there will be returned, and we will continue to consult with the population that expresses a desire to live with Russia."" The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that ""Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River."" Putin said in televised comments that he had signed a decree making ""corrections"" to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian president said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Putins ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week after the measures were proposed, a timescale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russias foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) would operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi , head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom , the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh , Ukraines governor of Zaporizhzhia , said that overnight ""the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed."" Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message ""Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible."" The Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova , famous for staging an on-air protest against Russias war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov , Russias ambassador to the United States, says Washingtons decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscows interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British prime minister, Liz Truss, has said that Ukraine ""will win"" and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said: ""The Ukrainian people arent just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace.

Updated at 09.02 EDT 5 Oct 2022 08.48 EDT Kate Connolly The former spokesperson to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and one of his erstwhile closest confidantes who was present during his only encounter with Vladimir Putin in 2019, has published a book in which she recalls her time working at Zelenskiys side, and does not shy away from criticising him. In The Fight of Our Lives: My Time With Zelenskiy, Ukraines Battle for Democracy and What It Means for the World, due for print publication in the UK on 27 October, Iuliia Mendel details her former bosss improbable rise from comedian to president, focusing on the two years she worked with him until the summer 2021. In an interview with the newspaper Bild, to coincide with the German publication of her book, Mendel said that no one in Ukraine had been prepared for war, not even Zelenskiy. But she says she believes Zelenskiy should have acted sooner on intelligence information that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. ""There is of course criticism in Ukraine. People say: 'If he knew, he should have told people so that they could have been brought to safety. I would say it was very unfair not to tell people anything. There is a lot of injustice contained in this behaviour. But if you ask me what I would have done as a leader, then I really dont know."" Mendel said that much of what Zelenskiy has done since the invasion has been ""very natural and intuitive. Very logical and correct."" ""I have often been asked about the transition of his image, from the suit to the T-shirt, and whether there were stylists behind the scenes,"" she said. But Zelenskiy she insists ""made all the decisions himself"" and there was ""no place for stylists"" in the air-raid bunker in which he lived with his core team for weeks on end. Updated at 11.38 EDT 5 Oct 2022 08.39 EDT Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders in the Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Kherson, has suggested on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have been suffering casualties during their attempt to push down into Kherson. He posted: The big game in the Kherson region continues. For many Ukronazis, this game has already ended on the outskirts. All who come with weapons to the territory of the Kherson region of the Russian Federation will be destroyed. 5 Oct 2022 08.28 EDT Jennifer Rankin The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putins ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. EU diplomats confirmed that the bloc had agreed to cap the price of Russian oil, after providing ""assurances"" to Greece, Cyprus and Malta, countries with large shipping industries. Prior to the agreement, these countries argued the oil price cap should not be imposed by the EU without guarantees that other non-EU countries, such as India, would also sign up to a price cap. The EU oil price cap follows a pledge by the G7 earlier this month. Under plans agreed by the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and Italy, firms shipping and insuring Russian oil will only be able to operate if they adhere to a price below a yet-to-be-determined level. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the agreement, saying the EU had moved quickly and decisively. I welcome the Member States agreement today on the 8th sanctions package. We have moved quickly and decisively. We will never accept Putins sham referenda nor any kind of annexation in Ukraine. We are determined to continue making the Kremlin pay. -- Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) October 5, 2022 EU officials will be relieved to have secured agreement before two days of summitry in Prague, partly intended as a show of solidarity with Ukraine.

Photograph: Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images Garry Kasparov, the former chess world champion and anti-Putin regime campaigner, has given an interview to the German news magazine Spiegel in which he says that ""every Russian who is living in Russia now is part of the war machine"" and demands that those who want to stand on the right side of history should leave. Kasparov tells the magazine that he has spent 20 years fighting against Vladimir Putin. ""I always said that his regime would unavoidably become a fascist threat - not only for Russia, not only for its neighbours, but for the entire world. It would have been nice if a few more people would have taken this warning to heart."" Asked by Spiegel if being abroad - he has lived in political exile since 2013 - he wasnt in too comfortable a position to be making such demands of those who have yet to leave Russia, he said: ""This is war. Either youre on one side of the front or the other. Every Russian citizen, including me, carries collective responsibility for this war, even if not a personal responsibility. Today Russia is a fascistic dictatorship, which, while were speaking here, is carrying out crimes against humanity. And everyone who is still living in Russia now, is a part of this war machinery, whether he wants to be or not."" Kasparov said Russians who want to be given asylum elsewhere should first have to sign a three-point declaration in which they would ""declare the war to be criminal, the Putin regime illegitimate and Ukraine indivisible"", Kasparov said. By signing it, the individual would be liable for prosecution in Russia on three counts according to laws Putin has put in place, he added. The 59-year old chess grandmaster makes the interesting claim that Putin ""never played chess, but poker, and he was good at geopolitical poker. He often played with bad cards and won, because his opponents fell for his bluff."" Updated at 08.52 EDT 5 Oct 2022 07.44 EDT The Financial Times is quoting Ihor Romanenko, a former deputy head of Ukraines general staff, on how vital it is that Ukrainian forces are able to make swift progress during this phase of their counter-offensive. The newspaper reports he said: Certainly it is crucial to advance swiftly in liberating occupied territory because there is a sense that changes in the weather will limit further active military actions in this region. If our allies were to help us by providing more of the modern weaponry we are asking for, then the situation would be much swifter and we would not be talking about the factor of weather. 5 Oct 2022 07.29 EDT Russian news agency RIA is carrying quotes from the deputy foreign minister of Russia Sergei Vershinin confirming that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi will be visiting Moscow. It quotes Vershinin saying: I confirm reports that Grossi is going to come to Kyiv, and then to Moscow. In terms of time, these will be the next few days. Vershinin went on to say: Grossi put forward a number of ideas that are now being discussed with experts. The task is nuclear safety and the exclusion of shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is carried out by the Ukrainian side, and the normal functioning of the nuclear power plant. The IAEA has previously called for a nuclear safety exclusion zone around the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Until now it has continued to be operated by staff employed by Energoatom, Ukraines state-enterprise which manages the plant. However, the plant sits on land that has now been claimed to be annexed by Russia, and Vershinin said: ""The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is now on the territory of the Russian Federation and, accordingly, should be operated under the supervision of our relevant agencies."" Both Russian and Ukraine have accused the other side of shelling the plant and risking a nuclear accident. Updated at 07.33 EDT 5 Oct 2022 07.12 EDT Reuters is reporting some diplomatic tension between Russia and Kazakhstan over the Ukraine war with Kazakh authorities rejecting a demand from Russia that they expel Ukraines ambassador over comments about killing Russians, chiding Moscow for what they called an inappropriate tone between ""equal strategic partners"". Ukraines ambassador in Astana, Petro Vrublevskiy, said in August in an interview with a local blogger that ""the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Tuesday said Moscow was ""outraged"" by the fact that Vrublevskiy was still in Astana and had summoned the Kazakh ambassador. Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov on Wednesday called Zakharovas tone ""discordant with the nature of the allied relations between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners"", adding that the Russian ambassador would in turn be summoned to the Kazakh ministry.

"['Isobel Koshiw', 'Lorenzo Tondo']",Ukraine's southern offensive 'was designed to trick Russia',2022-09-10 18:00:33,Exclusive: Russian forces wrong-footed by attack in Kharkiv region after preparing for offensive in the south,"The much-publicised Ukrainian southern offensive was a disinformation campaign to distract Russia from the real one being prepared in the Kharkiv region, Ukraines special forces have said. Ukrainian forces are continuing to make unexpected, rapid advances in the north-east of the country, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region in three days. Much of Ukraines territorial gains were confirmed by Russias defence ministry on Saturday. ""[It] was a big special disinformation operation,"" said Taras Berezovets, a former national security adviser turned press officer for the Bohun brigade of Ukraines special forces. ""[Russia] thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment. Then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee."" On 29 August, Ukraines southern command announced that the long-anticipated offensive in the Kherson region had begun. But soldiers on the Kherson frontline said at the time that they saw no evidence of said offensive or that the active battles taking place were a reaction to an attempted Russian offensive several days earlier. For the past two weeks, Ukrainian forces in the south took several villages - no small feat given the reported strength of Russian positions and one which nevertheless resulted in injuries. But the gains were not remarkably different from the steady but limited progress Ukrainian forces had been making in the Kherson region over July and August. And yet, the capture of these tiny Kherson villages, with populations of a few thousands, suddenly became big international news. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraines southern command, had insisted on a ""regime of silence"" and temporarily banned journalists from visiting the frontlines in Kherson. But Berezovets said the media stir around the southern offensive was a coordinated disinformation campaign by Ukraine, targeted at Russian forces, that had been building for several months. It was successful in provoking Russia to move equipment and personnel to the southern front, including partly from Kharkiv region, said Berezovets. ""Meanwhile [our] guys in Kharkiv were given the best of western weapons, mostly American,"" he said. Part of the special operation involved rooting out informants in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Kharkiv to stop them passing information about Ukraines preparations to the Russians, said a military source with knowledge of the operation. ""The [informants] were almost completely cleaned up. They mostly comprised normal Ukrainian civilians but there were some Russian agents undercover as Ukrainian civilians,"" said the source. ""The Russians had no idea what was going on."" Russias defence ministry has confirmed the retreat, describing it as a regroup. It says it has retreated from Izium and the town of to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. ""A three-day operation was carried out on the drawdown and organised transfer of the Izium-Balakliia group of troops to the territory of the Donetsk Peoples Republic,"" said the Russian defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov. ""In order to prevent damage to the Russian troops, a powerful fire defeat was inflicted on the enemy."" Russian state media and bloggers have confirmed Russian soldiers have been forced to make a large-scale retreat from Kharkiv. Ukrainian troops have in the past few days pushed Russian forces out of a number of settlements in the region that Moscow occupied since the first days of its invasion. In a video address late on Friday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian forces had liberated more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region. A local resident of Izium, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that the Ukrainian troops had entered the city. Before that, ""Russian occupying forces were rapidly withdrawing, leaving ammunition and equipment behind"". Ukraines retake of Izium could be its most significant success in pushing back the Russians since the beginning of the invasion. By capturing the nearby town of Kupiansk, Ukrainian forces have managed to cut off the supply lines for the Russian formations in control of the Izium area,"" said Serhiy Kuzan, a military expert at the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center. Kuzan said the Russian formations in charge of the south-east area of Kharkiv, labelled the Izium area by military experts, were professional Russian soldiers, not mercenaries or conscripts from Russian-occupied Donbas. The offensive has been carried out at lightning speed, with a third of occupied Kharkiv being captured by Ukrainian forces in just a matter of days, he said. The UKs Ministry of Defence has said Ukraines counter-offensive took Russian forces by surprise, adding that Kyivs forces had advanced 50km (31 miles) along a narrow frontline and retaken or surrounded several towns. With Ukrainian operations also continuing in Kherson, the Russian defensive front is under pressure on both its northern and southern flanks,"" it said. ""We are actually surprised by how poorly the Russians have retreated,"" said Kuzan. ""Retreat is part of the art of war. When we retreated, we made sure they suffered losses as they advanced and we did to so to ensure that they only advanced 1, 2, 3 kilometres. ""They were so confident that they didnt prepare their defences,"" he added. ""This has shown that the only advantage they have is in the number of artillery pieces and heavy equipment. So all we need is the same amount."" After the big territorial gains made this week by Ukraine, Moscow is sending columns of military reinforcements to the Kharkiv region, according to reports in Russian media.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/10/ukraines-publicised-southern-offensive-was-disinformation-campaign

['Luke Harding'],Russia no longer has full control of Luhansk region after Ukraine captures village,2022-09-19 16:34:33,Small but symbolic victory in suburb of Lysychansk undermines one of Putins key war aims,"Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putins key war aims. Luhansks governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraines armed forces were in ""complete control"" of Bilohorivka. ""Its a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,"" he said. ""Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders."" Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces had occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two and a half months. After a long and grinding battle, Ukraines general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days, Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv. Over the weekend, Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the rivers left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counteroffensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peoples Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people from learning about Moscows military setbacks, he claimed.

Photograph: Oleksandr Lapin/Ukrinform/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin on Monday of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. Ukraines state nuclear company, Energoatom, said all three of its nuclear reactors were working normally and had not been damaged. ""Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff,"" it said. The agency published two photographs showing a large crater that it said was caused by the blast. ""They forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before its too late,"" Zelenskiy wrote on his Telegram channel. He has previously accused Putin of nuclear terrorism and blackmail and has called on the international community to intervene. 00:22 Footage released by Ukraine purports to show shelling at nuclear plant in Pivdennoukrainsk - video The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces since the start of the invasion. Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive to liberate the nearby city of Kherson. It has made slower progress than in the Kharkiv region, across a flat steppe terrain and with Russian units dug in. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant, at Zaporizhzhia - which is Europes largest and lies about 155 miles (250km) east of the Mykolaiv site - was shut down this month owing to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend that one of the four main power lines at Zaporizhzhia had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russia soldiers have used the territory to shell the Ukrainian-controlled cities of Nikopol and Marhanets across the Dnieper River. More than 40 countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency have urged Putin to hand control of the station back to Ukraine.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/19/russia-no-longer-has-full-control-of-luhansk-as-ukraine-recaptures-village
['Shaun Walker'],The men who go to Ukraine looking for a wife then fly home alone and broke,2014-04-04 00:00:00,"<strong>Shaun Walker:</strong> After chatting online, travelling to Odessa and wooing women on flashy dates, most men fly home alone and far poorer. Are they unlucky in love, or have they been scammed?","These are trying times for Odessa. After the annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian forces are stirring tension in this Black Sea port, and there are weekly standoffs between demonstrators who want to be part of Ukraine and those who want closer ties to Russia. But for all the political and economic chaos that has engulfed Ukraine in the past three months, one industry is still thriving: the internet romance trade. The economies of several Ukrainian cities are boosted by the surreal and disingenuous online bride business, and Odessa is the biggest hub. It does not take long for a visitor to the city to stumble upon an ""international date"" - there are legions of western men in town meeting with young women they have met online, usually with the conversation facilitated by a translator. At internet cafes and homes across the city, thousands of women spend hours each day chatting to prospective suitors online. There is nothing like the prospect of economic hardship to facilitate intercontinental liaisons, and so, far from business drying up in recent months, the romance and ""bride"" trade is booming. If anything, there are now more western men planning trips to Odessa than there were last year, when I accompanied a ""romance tour"" to Ukraine for a magazine story. I spent a week in Odessa with 29 men, all of them hoping to find a wife during their trip. They were mainly Americans, but there were also Brits, an Italian and a Saudi on the tour. I went with a company called Anastasia International, which is no grimy basement operation, but a huge company with a projected revenue last year of $140m (PS84m). It has thousands of women in Ukraine and across the world on its books, available for chats and in-person meetings with lonely bachelors across the world looking for a wife. As internet dating has gone mainstream over the past decade, Anastasia is attempting to rebrand what was once called the ""mail-order bride"" industry as something modern and progressive. This is no longer the preserve of seedy and exploitative men seeking vulnerable women from impoverished backgrounds to work as a longterm sex slave, the marketing suggests. This is ""international dating"", a civilised way to find romance without borders. Except that the branding is still somewhat disturbing. The men pay for every minute they chat online to a woman, something that it becomes clear is a dangerous part of the business model. The company claims on its website that finding a woman in Ukraine is like ""dating a model, but with the values of your grandmother"". The men featured in testimonials are sick of western women, whom they insist have forgotten ""family values"". 'This is game time' Armed with this information, I was fully expecting to spend a week being nauseated by odious men preying on vulnerable women, and there were certainly a few on the trip whose misogyny reached prize-winning levels. But the overall story was far more complex. ""This is game time and they're blowing me off,"" Todd told me, mystified, one day over breakfast. It took the 43-year-old bread-delivery man from Delaware several months of working overtime to be able to afford the tour to Ukraine; he often clocked seven night shifts a week in order to save the roughly $5,000 (PS3,000) he paid to spend a week in Odessa, and hopefully find a wife. Todd, who had not succeeded in finding his other half at home, had something of a compulsive side to his personality. He spent months methodically whittling down 1,500 possible brides on Anastasia's site to two top candidates. He then spent thousands of hours and thousands of dollars chatting with them online. Things were going swimmingly with both women. He assumed that his trip to Odessa would involve picking the one he liked most and taking her back with him. But when he arrived, neither of them answered his calls. While Todd's expectations for what a Ukrainian bride might offer were patently unrealistic, it was troubling to watch him venture ever further down the path of disappointment. Many of the men on the tour were less sympathetic characters than Todd, but all of them were lonely. Some of them were disillusioned with dating scenes in the west, where women did not give them a look; others recovering from a divorce or the death of a spouse. Another man I spent a lot of time with was Stephen, a 62-year-old from Texas, long-divorced, who was on his 11th trip to Ukraine with the desperate hope of finding a wife. ""I want a companion, because there are things I would like to do back home, but I don't want to do them alone,"" he told me. ""I want to see the Grand Canyon, but I don't want to see it on my own. I'm tired of having nobody to share my life with."" Stephen ended up meeting a pianist named Elena on the tour. On date two she told him she thought he could be her soulmate. By the end of the week he was sure he had found his future life partner. It was an expensive week, with the dinners, taxis, and payment for a translator all adding up, but Stephen was delighted that he had found love. But love in Odessa is not all it seems. Perhaps 10 years ago, the scenario had been what I imagined, with men swooping in, and women keen to swap the hard grind of poverty-stricken Ukraine for a new life in the US, even if it was a ramshackle house in a North Dakotan town or a sleepy midwestern farm, rather than a Manhattan penthouse or LA beachfront home. Now, it seems, things are different. None of the men I became close to on my tour ended up in lasting relationships, and the majority appeared to fall victim to a number of sophisticated scams. I left Stephen ready to propose, but two months later he told me by email that it had all unravelled. The woman let him know she needed more time before making a commitment, but suggested that he return to Odessa and continue their expensive platonic dates. Todd did not even get to the date stage; in retrospect, perhaps a lucky escape. The women took their cut of cash for chatting with him, but did not answer his calls when he arrived. He later wrote to me: ""It took me about a month to process what happened and get over it. I've decided to close that chapter in my life and move on. I am now concentrating on me and my life and to do things that make me a better person. And to pursue the other hopes and dreams that I have. Will I ever find my other half? One can only wonder. At least I can say I tried. If I die a bachelor, so be it."" 'Emotional prostitution' I was able to uncover exactly how the scams work due to a chance encounter with Alina, one of the women involved, who felt weighed down by her collusion in what she called ""emotional prostitution"". She explained the whole sordid array of techniques, from a light impersonalised online-chatting version to a full-service chauffeur-driven platinum fraud, where men are rinsed of cash for a full week in Odessa, thinking they are cementing a lifelong relationship while actually they are being strung along on platonic dates that end with them dispatched to the airport with heavy hearts and empty wallets. Many of them come with ridiculous expectations, of course, but I am not sure that anyone deserves this treatment. For the women as well, although hundreds of them make a living from the scams, it is not an easy psychological burden to bear. Alina was evidence of that, and 29-year-old Chris, the tour's youngest member, found that when he confronted his date with accusations about the nature of the business, she burst into tears and said she felt awful, but needed the money to support her mother after her father had died. Other women were genuinely looking for a young and interesting partner and wanted to leave Ukraine, but spent hours chatting with elderly men in order to make money. Anastasia International, while not directly colluding in the scams, runs a highly profitable business model that allows them to flourish. While real and lasting liaisons do occasionally form through the site, more often it only serves to increase the concentric circles of mistrust, disappointment and heartbreak for all involved. Anastasia insists that it weeds out scams whenever it finds them, and has banned some women from the site. It also says it will reimburse clients who fall victims to scams, and provides advice on how to avoid them. Larry Cervantes, the company spokesman, wrote to me after the tour: ""It's true that some of these guys are spending money they don't have. But guys go broke in the US chasing American women, as do Brits chasing Brits. So what's the difference? Throughout history men have pursued the unattainable, and throughout history they've made fools of themselves. How is this any different?"" But the difference, of course, is that the company is making a huge profit from the men making fools of themselves, and while many women are making money out of the schemes too, it is not clear that it is beneficial to them in the longer term. Far from ending the practice, the recent unrest in Ukraine has only enhanced it. Alina told me that her friends working in the business are expecting several American men to arrive in the coming days, while the less discreetly named sugardaddyforme.com says it has seen record numbers of Ukrainian women sign up in recent months. The new Ukrainian government has rather a lot on its plate, but ending the trade in emotional exploitation is something they should tackle sooner rather than later.

['Jon Henley'],"Westerners in no mood for concessions to Russia in Ukraine, poll finds",2022-10-14 12:27:18,"Exclusive: Survey shows strong support within alliance for tougher sanctions and Nato aid, but more pro-Russia views elsewhere","Nearly eight months into Vladimir Putins war on Ukraine, citizens in core western alliance countries show little appetite for the kind of concessions to Russia that might form part of an eventual agreement to end the fighting, according to a major survey. The YouGov-Cambridge globalism project, which gauged public opinion in 25 of the worlds largest countries, also found strong support for maintaining, and often toughening and expanding, military and economic measures against Moscow. But while the survey found respondents in most western nations in an uncompromising mood, multiple countries around the world - including some in the west - were markedly more ambivalent, or even sympathetic, towards Russia. ""If Putin is counting on waning western resolve, this research suggests more bad news for his beleaguered military campaign,"" said Joel Rogers de Waal, YouGovs academic director. ""But its not an international consensus."" The polling, between 24 August and 22 September, found that of 13 western or anglophone countries - France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, the UK, US, Australia and Canada - a ""core group"" of 10 backed maintaining economic sanctions on Russia. Greece, Hungary and Italy were outliers. Among the remaining 10 countries, support for sanctions ranged from a low of 57% or 58% in France and Germany, through 60%, 62% and 65% in Canada, the US and Poland, to highs of more than 70% in the UK, Sweden and Denmark. In those same 10 countries, significant numbers - 62% in Poland, 57% in Sweden, 50% in the UK, 40-50% in France, Germany, Spain and the US - also felt existing sanctions were ""not harsh enough"" and should be strengthened. Many western voters were willing to pay a price for this, with about half or more - 66% in Denmark, 63% in the UK - favouring sanctions even if their living costs increased slightly (support dipped if a ""large increase"" was implied, but by no more than about 10 points). Militarily, there was substantial backing for Nato aid to Ukraines forces, including the supply of arms, intelligence and out-of-country training; cyber and information warfare aimed at the Russian government; and even for military advisers inside Ukraine (as long as they stayed out of the fighting). A majority in all 10 core western countries also favoured deploying non-violent ""hybrid warfare"" measures, such as targeting Russian media with alternative information - but there was little core western support (30-40% in most countries, falling to just 20% in Germany) for direct Nato military involvement. ""For all the public noise this year about the dangers of global nuclear catastrophe erupting from the war, a lot of western voters are undaunted in their view that Nato should continue sustaining the Ukrainian war effort,"" Rogers de Waal said. Perhaps most intriguingly, most western respondents showed little appetite for much - if any - compromise with the Kremlin over how the conflict might end. The survey asked whether they would support various concessions to Moscow - an end to sanctions, Russian sovereignty over Crimea, independence for Donetsk and Luhansk, and a guarantee that Ukraine would not join Nato - if Russia agreed to stop fighting and to give up all, most, some or none of its Ukrainian territorial gains. ""Whats striking is how generally low the level of support is for giving concessions to Russia in any of those scenarios - and how the difference between Russia relinquishing all of its newly occupied Ukrainian territory and none makes only a limited difference to the overall result,"" Rogers de Waal said. Only 13% of respondents in France, for example, backed recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea if Moscow gave up none of its new Ukrainian territory - but the percentage was not very different (17%) if it surrendered all of it. In Germany, the corresponding figures were 20% for ""all"" and 17% for ""none""; in Sweden 13% and 10%, in Spain 18% and 16%; Poland 12% and 11%, Britain 10% and 6% and the US 15% and 13%. Three European countries were consistent exceptions in the west. Asked whether Nato was doing too much to help Ukraine, only 7% in Denmark, Poland and the UK answered yes - but the figures in Italy, Greece and Hungary were 22%, 23% and 31%. At 37% and 32%, support in Greece and Hungary for maintaining sanctions on Russia was half some western countries, while barely a fifth of Greek and Hungarian respondents backed Nato sending heavy weapons to Ukraine, against 44% in France, 57% in the UK and 65% in Poland. Italy often fell between Hungary and Greece, on the one hand, and the core western bloc on the other. Similarly, Greece, Hungary and Italy were significantly more likely to favour concessions to Russia: for example, 31% of respondents in Greece, 28% in Hungary and 23% in Italy favoured recognising Russian sovereignty over Crimea even if Russia gave up none of its new Ukrainian territory, against 8% in Denmark and 6% in the UK. Beyond the west - the survey also covered Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - many other countries were markedly more pro-Russian.

For example, only about 35% of respondents backed economic sanctions in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Thailand, and barely a third in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia supported Nato sending heavy weapons to Ukraine. The propaganda war Only minorities in 25 countries around the world - ranging from 3%-6% in the UK and Spain to 22% in India and 23% in Saudi Arabia - believe the world would be a safer place if Russia achieved its aims in Ukraine. In the west, most respondents overwhelmingly rejected the narrative spun by Moscow to justify its invasion of Ukraine and broadly accepted the alliance view of what was causing the war, the YouGov-Cambridge study found. ""If the Kremlin has failed to achieve its original military aims on the ground in Ukraine, so it has also struggled to prevail in the wider information war to define the causes of and justifications for the conflict,"" Rogers de Waal said. In the same 10 core western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, Sweden and Poland, barely 20% - and just 8% in the UK - said they believed Russias line that the invasion aimed to protect ethnic Russians from genocide. Similarly low numbers accepted another Russian argument, that Ukraine had fallen under the influence of nazism, with slightly more - but generally less than 25% - believing Moscows claim that the west had tried use Ukraine as a base to threaten Russia. Among the core 10, the western view that Russia had invaded because Putin did not view Ukraine as a proper country, and that the war was driven by Russian imperialism and a desire to increase Russias global status, was backed by 65%-79%. Again, however, Greece, Hungary and to a lesser extent Italy were notable exceptions in Europe, with 43% of Greeks believing Kyiv was in the grip of Nazi sympathisers and 41% of Hungarians saying the west had sought to threaten Russia from Ukraine. Several countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Turkey, reflected similar beliefs - although, significantly, all 25 countries around the world showed strong, generally majority support for the view that it was Russian imperialism and status that lay behind the war. On the key question of whether Russia was more to blame than the west, responses followed broadly the same pattern, with strong majorities in the core western alliance (up to 78% in Sweden, Denmark and the UK) blaming Russia, and correspondingly very low numbers (4% in Poland, 6% in Spain, 7% in France) blaming the west. In Greece and Hungary, however, only 37% and 35% said Russia was more to blame, although those percentages were still greater than those pointing the finger at the west. Outside the west, the numbers saying Russia bore responsibility for starting for the war were also lower: 23% in Egypt, for example, 26% in Turkey, 34% in Thailand, 44% in Nigeria. But, tellingly, of all the 25 countries surveyed, only in Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia did more respondents (24%, 28% and 26%) believe that the west was more to blame for the war in Ukraine than was Russia (23%, 27% and 15%).",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/14/westerners-in-no-mood-for-concessions-to-russia-in-ukraine-poll-finds
"['Samantha Lock', 'Rachel Hall', 'Martin Belam']",Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 225 of the invasion,2022-10-06 14:08:11,Missile strike on Zaporizhzhia residential buildings; Putin appears to admit severe losses in Ukraine; IAEA chief heads to Kyiv,"Ukrainian emergency services said that a total of three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia . Authorities said seven rockets hit the city early on Thursday morning. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. More explosions were reported in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time, but there were no further casualties. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlins recent military reversals and insisting Russia would ""stabilise"" the situation in four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. ""We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,"" Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. ""On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,"" International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was ""more urgent than ever"". Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraines forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraines military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its militarys southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were ""liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised,"" in an address on Wednesday. Kherson regions Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical ""regrouping"" to ""deliver a retaliatory blow"". The extent of Russias retreat remains unclear. Moscows forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russias isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Unions foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. ""The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,"" he told reporters. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UNs highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. The filing signifies a change in Moscows attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly. The UN has warned Russias claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented ""a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security"" and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. ""Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?"" Olga Skabeyeva, the countrys top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: ""I really dont know what to say to you. The retreat ... is catastrophic."" Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-225-of-the-invasion

It comes after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the ICRC of inaction in upholding the rights of Ukrainian prisoners and called on it to visit Olenivka, a notorious camp in eastern Ukraine where dozens of Ukrainian POWs died in an explosion and fire in July (see also 6.14am). Heres the ICRCs statement: We share the frustration regarding our lack of access to all prisoners of war (POWs) held in the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We have been working since February to obtain access to check on the conditions and treatment of POWs and keep their families informed about their loved ones. We have been able to visit hundreds of POWs but there are thousands more who we have not been able to see. The Third Geneva Convention obliges parties to an international armed conflict to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediate access to all POWs, and the right to visit them wherever they are held. We want to stress that our teams are ready on the ground--and have been ready for months--to visit the Olenivka penal facility and any other location where POWs are held. However, beyond being granted access by high levels of authority, this requires practical arrangements to materialise on the ground. We cannot access by force a place of detention or internment where we have not been admitted. All States have committed to respect the Geneva conventions. Giving the ICRC access to visit prisoners of war is a legal obligation. It also helps preserve humanity in an international armed conflict that has created immeasurable loss for countless families. Our mission can only be achieved through coordinated efforts with parties to the conflict. And we ask them and the international community to support the role we have been given.

Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Updated at 07.39 EDT 10h ago 06.02 EDT Summary of the day so far ... Russia announced it will evacuate residents from Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian region will become a new frontline. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy , has issued a message to celebrate Defenders Day in Ukraine, saying ""Gratitude to everyone who fought for Ukraine in the past. And to everyone who is fighting for it now. To all who won then. And to everyone who will definitely win now."" Ukraines army boasted of territorial gains near the city of Kherson on Wednesday as Nato allies including the UK delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russias recent missile attacks across the country. The UK Ministry of Defence says that ""Russia continues to prosecute offensive operations in central Donbas and is, very slowly, making progress"". The ministry explained that, ""in the last three days, pro-Russian forces have made tactical advances towards the centre of the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast"" and ""likely advanced into the villages of Opytine and Ivangrad to the south of the town."" Ukraines armed forces have liberated more than 600 settlements from the Russian occupation in the past month , including 75 in the highly strategic Kherson region, Ukraines Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporary Occupied Territories claimed late on Thursday. Oleh Synyehubov , the governor of Kharkiv , has said that two 16-year-old boys were among those injured by Russian shelling in the region in the last 24 hours. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is reporting that people have been killed and there are wounded after an ammunition dump in Oktyabrsky village in the Belgorod region of Russia exploded. Authorities have blamed the explosion on shelling over the border by Ukrainian armed forces. Train operations were also suspended early on Friday near Novyi Oskol, a town in Russias Belgorod region after remains of a missile fell near the railway. Ukraine has accused the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of inaction in upholding the rights of Ukrainian prisoners of war and urged it to undertake a mission to a camp in the Russian-occupied east of the country. Elon Musk appears to have confirmed on Twitter that funding for the Space X Starlink satellite internet system in Ukraine is being pulled. The company is asking the US government to step in and foot the bill. The move comes days after Musk faced huge criticism in Ukraine for a Twitter poll he conducted on a peace proposal that appeared to show Musks support for Vladimir Putins military aims in Ukraine. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. Miranda Bryant will be with you shortly. I will be back later. Take care. Updated at 07.39 EDT 11h ago 05.33 EDT Pjotr Sauer Pjotr Sauer writes for the Guardian today on the story of Artur, a 27-year-old fighting with the Ukrainian armed forces, and his father Oleg, a colonel in the pro-Moscow forces in eastern Ukraine: While most young Ukrainians were concerned for the safety of their parents, Artur, 27, had a different message for his father, Oleg. ""You assholes,"" the text to his father read. ""Dont pick up a gun. Kyiv will fall immediately,"" Oleg replied after some time. Throughout the war he has kept in touch with his father in Russian-occupied Donetsk through text messages that he has shared with the Guardian. ""We are literally on the opposite sides of the frontline. But only one of us is fighting for the right cause,"" said Artur in a video call from Zakarpattia oblast. In early March, after most Russian troops had been repelled from Kyiv, Artur sent a short video message to his father, mocking him for his earlier warning about the fall of the capital. ""I am walking around but cant see a single Russian. They seem to have disappeared. Can you please advise, I dont understand where they are?"" he said in the video. Oleg replied that Russias fortunes would soon change, once again urging his son to drop his weapons. ""At that point, I already saw that his hopes of a Russian victory were dwindling. He started to become more desperate as Ukraine was gaining more ground.""

A screenshot of the Elon Musk tweet Photograph: Twitter In the poll, Musk suggested the Ukraine should remain neutral, cede Crimea to Russia permanently, and re-run Russias ""referendums"" in the areas of Ukraine that it militarily occupies. Screenshot of exchange between Elon Musk and Andrij Menyk Photograph: Twitter It should be noted that in the CNN report that says SpaceX is to pull funding, the news organisation suggests that the process was initiated with a letter to the US government in September, which pre-dates Musks Twitter poll, in which he appeared to side with Vladimir Putins strategic aims in invading Ukraine, and which drew a stinging response from Ukrainians, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 12h ago 04.00 EDT There is a quick snap from Reuters that a Russian government document has been published which states that repairs to the Crimea bridge between the annexed Crimean peninsula and southern Russia, which was damaged in an explosion last Saturday, are to be finished by July 2023. 13h ago 03.55 EDT Elon Musk to pull funding for Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine - reports Elon Musks SpaceX says it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine, according to an overnight report by CNN which it has labelled an exclusive. SpaceX is reportedly asking the US government to start paying instead. In the report, Alex Marquardt writes: Documents obtained by CNN show that last month Musks SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraines government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120m for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400m for the next 12 months. ""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" SpaceXs director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter. SpaceX, founded by one of the worlds richest people, activated the service in Ukraine shortly after Russia began staging its latest invasion in February 2022. Musk, under federal investigation over his deal to try and buy Twitter, has been heavily criticised in recent days after posting a poll on Twitter which appeared to side with Vladimir Putins military aims, with Musk proposing that Ukraine permanently cede Crimea, remain neutral, and to allow a re-staging of ""referendums"" in the areas under the military occupation of Russia. 13h ago 03.43 EDT People killed in ammunition dump explosion in Belgorod in Russia - reports The Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is reporting that people have been killed and there are wounded after an ammunition dump in Oktyabrsky village in the Belgorod region of Russia exploded.

"['Dan Sabbagh', 'Luke Harding']","Ukraine aiming to create chaos within Russian forces, Zelenskiy adviser says",2022-08-16 16:36:26,Exclusive: Mykhailo Podolyak says Russian supply lines will be targeted and predicts similar attacks to last weeks explosion at Crimean airbase,"Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating ""chaos within Russian forces"" by striking at the invaders supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian there could be more attacks in the ""next two or three months"" similar to Tuesdays mysterious strikes on a railway junction and an airbase in Crimea, as well as last weeks hit on Russian warplanes at the peninsulas Saky aerodrome. Russia said a fire on Tuesday had set off explosions at a munitions depot in the Dzhankoi district of Crimea - an incident that Podolyak said was a reminder that ""Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves"". Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks. They have prompted Russian tourists to flee Crimea in panic. There were queues on Tuesday outside the railway station at the regional capital, Simferopol. The defence ministry in Moscow said it was dealing with cases of sabotage and taking ""necessary measures"" to prevent further episodes. 00:45 Footage purports to show explosion at ammunition depot in Crimea - video Speaking from the presidential offices in Kyiv, Podolyak said: ""Our strategy is to destroy the logistics, the supply lines and the ammunition depots and other objects of military infrastructure. Its creating a chaos within their own forces."" The adviser, often described as the countrys third most powerful figure, said Kyivs approach ran counter to Moscows use of blunt artillery power to gain territory in the Donbas region to the east, which has seen Russian troops destroy cities such as Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk in order to gain territory. ""So Russia has kind of taught everybody that a counteroffensive requires huge amounts of manpower like a giant fist and just go in one direction,"" he said, but ""a Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different. We dont use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century."" An infrared overview of Saky airbase after the attack. Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters However, the remarks could also be interpreted as an acknowledgment that Ukraine is struggling to amass the amount of men and military material required to sustain a full counteroffensive in the south of the country, which typically requires a superiority of three or more soldiers to one. Instead, Ukraine has tried to cut off Kherson, the one city held by Russia on the west bank of the Dnieper River, by damaging road and rail bridges using newly supplied western rocket artillery to the point where it is no longer possible for Russia to resupply its forces effectively. Podolyak asked for ""50, 60, 80 more"" MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) on top of an existing arsenal of about 20, 16 of which are truck-mounted Himars supplied by the US. Three - the track-wheeled M270 - have come from the UK, with three more promised, which the adviser described as ""very good"". Soldiers with an M270 system during a military exercise in Germany last month. Photograph: Christof Stache/AFP/Getty Images Helped by the long-range missiles supplied by the west, Podolyak added that Ukraine hoped to degrade the invaders strength through ""lack of supplies and lack of ammunition"" that ""will make Russians fight like they did on the first months of the war"". In the early phase of the conflict a disorganised Russian military failed to capture Kyiv after the invading forces became clogged up in a series of traffic jams on roads leading into the city, making them vulnerable to Ukrainian infantry and anti-tank weapons. The presidential aide suggested that last weeks airbase attack could have been the work of partisans, but playfully dismissed any suggestion it could have been an accident, as had been suggested by Moscow in its immediate aftermath. Podolyak said Russians had ""a different physics"" if they believed the blasts the result of discarded cigarettes causing munitions dumps to explode, before going on to anticipate a repeat of such attacks behind the lines in the future.

""I certainly agree with the Russian ministry for defence, which is predicting more incidents of this kind in the next two, three months. I think we might see more of those happening,"" Podolyak said. Rising smoke can be seen from the beach at Saky after the airbase attack. Photograph: AP He also signalled that Ukraine regards the Crimean Bridge linking the occupied peninsula with the Russian mainland as a legitimate military target. ""Its an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed,"" he said. Although Ukraine has refused to take public responsibility for the attack on the Saky airbase, it has done so in private, and the incident has come at time when a string of Russian strategic targets have been hit deep behind the frontline. On Monday there was speculation that Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman reportedly tied to the Wagner private military company, could have been wounded or killed in a Ukrainian rocket strike in the Donbas. Photos published by a Russian journalist of the mans meeting with Wagner mercenaries in east Ukraine made the location of the base easy to identify. And on Sunday, the building at Mironivska was hit by a Ukrainian artillery strike, probably from a Himars system. Podolyak, who was a peace talks negotiator in the early phases of the conflict, said there was no prospect of Russia negotiating seriously until it experienced a defeat on the battlefield. He said some unnamed European countries were ""under the illusion"" that the Kremlin may seek talks in good faith. ""Russian ears only open up when there is a giant military bat hitting the Russian head,"" he said. He praised Britains role in supporting Ukraine so far, which in some respects had exceeded that of the US, and said he expected strong support to continue after Boris Johnson steps down as prime minister. ""You became a giant - its hard to go back to being a midget,"" he said. Johnson had offered ""personal and emotional backing"" to Zelenskiy in the ""darkest day of Ukrainian history"", Podolyak said.

['Barbie Latza Nadeau'],World's Richest Man Elon Musk Says He'll Just 'Fuck Off' and Stop Paying for Starlink to Support Ukraine,2022-10-14 11:15:06,"Musk says he just taking the advice of a senior Ukrainian diplomat who told him to ""fuck off.""","Elon Musk has never been subtle when it comes to his emotions--and Friday morning he said he was flouncing out of a commitment to help Ukraine on the advice of a Kyiv diplomat who told him to ""fuck off."" Musks SpaceX says it will no longer pay for the Ukrainian military to use his Starlink internet system. The truth is that his companies have been trying to wriggle off the hook for the multi-million dollar bill for months, according to a report by CNN. News broke Thursday, that SpaceX was no longer going to pay for the satellite communications network, which has been crucial in allowing Ukraine to fight back against Putins invasion. When journalist Jason Jay Smart tweeted that the move came just days after a Ukrainian diplomat told him Musk ""fuck off"", Musk replied: ""Were just following his recommendation,"" with a shrug emoji. The previous tweet from the Ukraine ambassador to Germany came in response to Musks apparent suggestion that Ukraine accept major territorial losses and become ""neutral"" in order to placate Putin and find a peaceful end to the invasion. ""Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,"" Andrij Melnyk wrote. What is being ""fucked off"" is the bill for the 20,000 Starlink satellite terminals Musks company has installed to aid the Ukraine military--and a request from Ukraine for around 9,000 more. The donation, Musk tweeted on Friday, has cost SpaceX some $80 million with a forecast of another $20 million by the end of 2022. SpaceX separately predicted that costs would reach nearly $400 million over the next 12 months, according to Politico. A report by CNN revealed a pair of letters SpaceX sent in September to the Pentagon in which the company firmly suggested the U.S. pay the bill for any further terminals. ""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" the letter, seen by CNN, stated. A second letter sent by a different SpaceX entity backed up the concern over continuing costs. ""SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here,"" the letter stated, according to CNN. ""I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy."" The donation, made by Musk days after Russia invaded the sovereign nation, is already funded in part by the U.S., U.K. and Poland. The terminals cost either $1,500 or $2,500, depending on capabilities, and Poland alone has funded around 9,000, SpaceX said previously. The debacle comes as the Financial Times reported outages of the service, which they say has caused strategic problems for Ukraine military on the battlefield. As the Twitter battle rages, the real war continues with a number of diplomats weighing in. The former prime minister of Finland--a country on the border with Russia with a lot at stake in the war--urged Musk to pipe down.

['Barbie Latza Nadeau'],Putin Suffers Most Humiliating Ukraine Defeat Yet,2022-09-30 12:28:30,Thousands of Russian troops may be trapped after a rapid-fire Ukrainian counter-attack fought to encircle a key strategic city on the very day Putin claimed to be annexing it.,"Moscow celebrated the annexation of huge swathes of Eastern Ukraine Friday but President Vladimir Putins party was wrecked by a lightning counter-attack that may have trapped thousands of his men in a key city supposedly now part of Russia. ""This is the will of millions of people,"" Putin said at a glitzy ceremony in front of high-ranking Russian diplomats still in the country. ""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever."" But as he gloated, Ukrainian sources claimed that the strategic city of Lyman, which has served as a Russian military hub in Donetsk, has been encircled and supply lines cut. ""Lyman! The operation to encircle the Russian group is at the stage of completion,"" said Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko on Friday. The claim could not be independently verified but, if confirmed, it would be one of the most serious Russian military losses of the war so far. Pro-Kremlin forces have conceded that the Ukrainians have made major gains in the region and are close to cutting off the Russian staging post in northern Donetsk, which has been under Russian control since July. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky tweeted that Russian forces would have to ""ask for an exit from Lyman"" if they want to surrender, adding, ""Only if, of course, those in the Kremlin are concerned for their soldiers."" Ukraine said earlier in the week they had made deep gains in the stronghold region and were close to taking back the territory--despite Putins claims that the region now belonged to an enlarged Russia. Speaking after Putins formally announced that four enclaves partially controlled by Russia would be subsumed into the country against all international law, Zelensky vowed to win them back. ""The entire territory of our country will be liberated from this enemy--the enemy not only of Ukraine, but also of life itself, humanity, law and truth,"" he said. The latest military humiliation for Moscow will continue to raise speculation that Putin could decide to lash out in new, more brutal ways. Russian state television political editor Maxim Yusin warned that Putin intended to push the button on a nuclear attack in the ""coming days or weeks,"" adding that people should ""have fun because it would be a shame to live out the remaining time with pessimism."" Military analysts say the recapture of Lyman could bolster morale and push the Ukrainian military to move to Luhansk province, which is the heart of the industrial region of the Donbas. Putin planned to annex Donbas after the bogus ballot referendum, which Western intelligence sources say was mostly held at gunpoint. Ukraines military outlined a large-scale counter attack. ""If Lyman falls, our forces can... cut the main supply corridor to Russian troops in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk [in Luhansk],"" Ukraines military General Staff said on Telegram. The British Ministry of Defense (MoD) said the gains came at the same time as a monumental supply issue for the Russians. ""Medical provision for Russian combat troops in Ukraine is probably growing worse,"" the MoD said Friday in its weekly war assessment bulletin. ""Some newly mobilized Russian reservists have been ordered to source their own combat first aid supplies, with the advice that female sanitary products are a cost-effective solution."" Among the other issues appears to be theft, with some new soldiers using zip ties to secure tourniquet supplies, rather than the standard Velcro attachments, which make them easier to steal. ""This is almost certain to hamper or render impossible the timely application of tourniquet care in the case of catastrophic bleeding on the battlefield,"" the MoD statement claims. ""Russian troops lack of confidence in sufficient medical provision is almost certainly contributing to a declining state of morale and a lack of willingness to undertake offensive operations in many units in Ukraine."" The British military also suggests that more Russians have escaped across the border than actually fought in the war so far after a mandatory draft was instated. ""The better off and well educated are over-represented among those attempting to leave Russia,"" they said. ""When combined with those reservists who are being mobilized, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labor and the acceleration of 'brain drain is likely to become increasingly significant."" Meanwhile in Moscow, plans for an annexation ceremony continue for Friday.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/putin-suffers-most-humiliating-ukraine-defeat-yet-around-key-city-of-lyman-in-donetsk
"['Dan Ladden-Hall', 'News Correspondent']",GCHQ Boss Jeremy Fleming Says Putin's Megalomania Is to Blame For Massive 'Strategic Errors' in Ukraine,2022-10-11 11:51:26,"The head of GCHQ says the disastrous invasion in Ukraine is being doomed by the Russian presidents ""flawed"" decision-making.","Russian President Vladimir Putins unchallenged power has led to catastrophic ""strategic errors"" that have been a disaster for the Kremlins invasion of Ukraine, according to one of Britains most senior spy chiefs. Sir Jeremy Fleming, the head of the U.K.s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), is set to give a damning analysis of Putins leadership during a rare public speech in London on Tuesday. The boss of Britains equivalent of the NSA will also say that ""Russias forces are exhausted"" and are facing a dangerous depletion of supplies and soldiers, now forced to rely on prisoners and involuntarily conscripts to prop up Moscows shambling war effort. ""Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, its clear that Ukraines courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,"" Sir Jeremy is set to say during a lecture at the Royal United Services Institute defense think tank, the Telegraph reports. ""Having failed in two major military strategies already, Putins plan has hit the courageous reality of Ukrainian defense. With little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed. Its a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment."" The spy boss will also say his agency has seen Russian forces on the frontline left in dire straits due to mismanagement of the conflict. ""Their gains are being reversed,"" Sir Jeremy will say. ""The costs to Russia--in people and equipment--are staggering. We know--and Russian commanders on the ground know--that their supplies and munitions are running out. Russias forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners to reinforce, and now the mobilization of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a desperate situation."" The searing analysis comes after Putin unleashed a brutal missile barrage across Ukrainian cities Monday which left at least 14 dead and 97 injured, according to the nations State Emergency Service. The deadly strikes--which supposedly targeted critical energy infrastructure but also managed to hit a pedestrian footbridge and a childrens playground in Kyiv--were launched in retaliation for a truck bombing which inflicted devastating damage to the Crimean Bridge over the weekend. Putin said Ukrainian intelligence forces were responsible for the ""act of terrorism"" on the 12-mile structure, which was built to connect Russia to Crimea following the Kremlins annexation of the peninsula in 2014. With Russia running out of reinforcements, friends, and supplies, Sir Jeremy separately told a BBC radio show that his agency was watching for indicators that Putin is considering using his nuclear arsenal. He did not suggest that there had been any signs detected so far, adding that any talk of nukes was itself ""very dangerous."" But the intelligence chief also believes Putins problems are mounting on the home front too, with Russian citizens beginning to see ""how badly Putin has misjudged the situation,"" Sir Jeremy will say in his lecture. ""Theyre fleeing the draft, realizing they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/gchq-boss-jeremy-fleming-says-putins-megalomania-is-to-blame-for-massive-strategic-errors-in-ukraine
['Julia Davis'],Russia Desperately Tries to Sell Its Ukraine War Draft as Citizens Flee,2022-09-25 20:47:57,The Kremlins talking heads tried to remain upbeat about calling up citizens to fight amid reports that men were being sent to the front after only one day of military training.,"Russias recently announced ""partial mobilization"" of men for the Ukraine war brought turmoil to the home front, where everyday citizens were suddenly greeted by a conflict many perceived as another countrys problem. Hundreds have been detained in anti-mobilization protests across the country, including Dagestan and the Sakha Republic, which are among the regions that have been heavily targeted for mass recruitment. Most state TV programs are promoting the idea that the mobilization is a necessary measure, unconvincingly claiming that its welcomed by the Russians at large. However, cracks are forming just beneath the surface, since even the most enthusiastic pro-Kremlin cheerleaders are unwittingly revealing too much to the alarmed Russian population. On Thursday, one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilization, Colonel Rustem Klupov, a retired military intelligence agent, appeared on the show Full Contact, hosted by Russias top propagandist Vladimir Solovyov. The host immediately asked Klupov whether he was ready for the mobilization and he enthusiastically confirmed: ""Yes, I took out my uniform and ironed it, got it all squared away, got my rapid deployment knapsack ready and bought two cans of Spam."" While his Colonels were buying Spam, Putin reportedly went off to rest up at his secret palace near Gelendzhik--providing yet another reminder about Russias resources being siphoned off by its leadership, which might explain why the countrys military is experiencing a lack of equipment and supplies during the Kremlins war of imperial conquest against the neighboring nation. Klupov told Solovyov that Ukraines fierce resistance to the occupying force was not the real reason for the mobilization. Instead, he claimed that NATOs extensive involvement was to blame, baselessly alleging that ""30 percent of the Ukrainian Army's personnel"" is comprised of NATO officers. Klupov also had an explanation as to why Putin decided to mobilize specifically 300,000 people: ""One of the reasons for this mobilization is that, subsequent to the Madrid Summit this summer, an announcement was made about the enlargement of NATO forces by 300,000 in the eastern part of Europe."" He also praised the idea of sending prisoners to fight in Ukraine, predicting that many of them would be reformed in the process, returning to Russia as model citizens. This only underscores the well-known shortage of troops Russia sent to Ukraine, since Putin initially anticipated--and his state media mouthpieces publicly predicted--a fast and easy invasion with minimal resistance. Klupov contradicted the promises made about the new recruits by Russias Defense Ministry and government officials, who vowed on state television that the newly mobilized soldiers would not be sent into combat zones, but instead be stationed in Ukrainian territories currently under Russias control. Klupov told Solovyov that the new arrivals with prior military experience would be immediately sent to the frontlines, whereas others would first receive between one and two months of training: ""They wont be immediately thrown into the furnace of war."" And yet, a recent report published by the independent Russian media outlet Mediazona revealed that some of the freshly-mobilized men are being sent directly to the frontlines after a whopping one day of ""training."" The wife of a man mobilized from Lipetsk, Tatyana Dotsenko, told the publication that her 45-year-old husband Andrei Kozyrev received his call-up notice on September 22. He was sent to the Belgorod region on a bus, was issued a bulletproof vest and a helmet, underwent one day of military exercises and then was told he is going to the frontline, having been assigned to the 237th tank regiment. She added: ""There were 1,000 of them, and no medical examination."" Even prominent pro-Kremlin propagandists are openly expressing their concerns with the mobilization. On Friday, Roman Babayan, the host of the TV program Own Truth on the channel NTV, said that he was worried about military enlistment offices grabbing people without much thought for their usefulness on the battlefront. Babayan also reiterated the well-known problem with Russias troops relying on public support to secure various supplies for the military: ""I hope that we will train these people well and equip these people well. I simply insist on that, because all of us know--and no one is hiding this information--that all of us are helping, sending money, there is crowdfunding, various foundations are working."" Babayans monologue again highlighted that partial mobilization was meant to counteract Russias military failures in Ukraine and not the phantom threat of NATOs expansion throughout Europe. He asserted: ""I hope that these people will not lack anything. Only then can we count on some changes in the situation on the battlefield, that it wont be dragged out indefinitely, and that it wont lead to us being forced to use tactical nuclear weapons, with the possibility of exchanging nuclear strikes."" While the escalating nuclear talk is meant to dissuade NATO countries from continuing to help Ukraine resist Russias invasion, even Russian analysts are getting tired of this loathsome strategy. Instead of scaring the opponents, they acknowledged that it reveals Russias weakness and highlights its inability to defeat Ukraine by conventional means. Appearing on the state TV show 60 Minutes on Friday, Dmitry Abzalov, Director of the Center for Strategic Communications, replied to the tirades about the possibility of using nuclear weapons by stating: ""I hope that we have enough strength and resources to solve these issues without nuclear war. Nuclear war is the very last resort... it would mean that everything else has failed."" Abzalov added: ""Nuclear war wont start, because I hope we wont start it.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-desperately-tries-to-sell-its-ukraine-war-draft-as-citizens-flee-towards-the-borders

Initial reports on social media identified the man as military veteran Dane Partridge from Idaho. When asked about those reports, a State Department spokesperson did not confirm the mans identity but verified that a U.S. citizen had recently been killed in the Donbas region of Ukraine. The spokesperson added that department officials are in touch with the mans family and that no further details about his death would be provided out of respect. On Facebook, posts from Partridges friends and family members said that he died Tuesday. Fellow veteran Matt Reeves wrote: ""Dane Partridge was one of my soldiers in D Company, Special Troops Battalion, 4th Infantry Division, during the 2007-2009 phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom."" Reeves added that Partridge ""left his wife, kids, and towing business to risk his life for the freedom of the Ukrainian people."" Posts on Partridges own Facebook account suggest he flew to Poland via Germany on April 26 after asking for donations ""to purchase newer body armor or uniforms"" earlier that month. On April 27, Partridge posted to say he was ""getting on a bus for the border"" and would no longer be updating where he was going or what he was doing for operational security reasons. ""I will let you all know Im alive,"" he added. The next update on the account ostensibly came from Partridges sister on Tuesday. ""Dane is still currently on life support from sustaining life threatening injuries while serving for the country of Ukraine,"" she wrote, along with images of Partridge. One showed him smiling, standing in the bed of a pickup truck while kitted out in combat gear--on his arm, a patch can be seen showing Pepe the Frog wearing a green helmet emblazoned with a gold trident in an apparent reference to the coat of arms of Ukraine. Another image showed Partridge lying apparently unconscious in a bed, a white bandage on his head, tubes in his nose and mouth. The post did not detail how the injuries were inflicted, saying simply that a doctor who examined the damage to Partridges spine, brain stem, and neck concluded his injuries were ""not conducive to life."" A later post confirmed that the family had been told Partridge had died. ""He was always good for a joke, witty banter and the occasional serious conversation,"" it read. ""He stayed true to his faith and spiritual convictions till his dying days."" The post added: ""He was a fine soldier who fought with valor and bravery on the battlefield. We have been told that he was known to be at the front of his team leading his men as he would never ask his men to do anything that he wasnt willing to do. Our lives have forever been changed by this stalwart man."" News of Partridges death comes after Luke Lucyszyn, 31, from South Carolina, and Californian Bryan Young, 51, were killed fighting in eastern Ukraine in July. Their deaths came after U.S. Marine veteran Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, died fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in February. U.S. Army veteran Joshua Jones, 24, from Memphis, Tennessee, died in Ukraine in August. Reeves eulogy for Partridge said that, contrary to social media reports, Partridges body remained in Kyiv as the ongoing conflict prevented his remains being repatriated. ""His family will go there when peace returns to place a headstone for him,"" Reeves said. ""However this war ends, whether, as I hope, with a total Ukrainian victory and Putin somehow in prison, after all the dying and loss is over, I hope the Ukrainian people will remember his sacrifice.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/idaho-father-and-army-vet-dane-partridge-named-by-family-as-soldier-killed-while-fighting-in-ukraine

['Anna Nemtsova'],Putin's Managed to Enrage His Last Supporters in Ukraine,2022-08-01 00:14:35,The Kremlin was convinced Russia would sweep through Ukraine because they had so many friendly faces and pro-Moscow assets in place. Not anymore.,"ODESA, Ukraine--Russia has been bombarding the seaside city of Odesa since the earliest days of its war in Ukraine--but the critical grain port has become a symbol of ongoing local resistance, where even former pro-Russian stalwarts are now embracing Ukrainian patriotism. ""The longer the war goes on, fewer people sympathize with Russia in Ukraine. Those who spoke Russian in everyday life, switch to Ukrainian,"" a long-time observer of Ukraines politics, Yevgeny Kisilyev, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. ""Even the most openly pro-Russian politicians, including Odesas mayor ... have turned into passionate enemies of [Russian president Vladimir] Putins regime."" Odesa, with its huge grain storage and shipping resources, is a much-desired target for Moscow. Russian missiles have been destroying the city since the first days of the war. In March and April, missiles killed dozens of civilians, including a three-month-old baby girl, Kira Glodan, her mother, and her grandmother. The tragedy angered Odesa but the massacre did not stop. On July 1, one of the missiles hit an apartment block in Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, killing 19 people. Weeks later, on July 20, ""Russia fired eight missiles that cost millions of dollars, which our forces brought down along with a Russian drone,"" Natalya Humeniuk, spokeswoman of the South Defense forces, told The Daily Beast in an interview last week. The relentless attacks from Russia have hardened local sentiments against Putin. ""During the first week of the war, Odesas mayor, Gennady Trukhanov--who many believed had a Russian passport--said nothing against Moscow,"" local activist Julia Grodetskaya told The Daily Beast. ""So concerned citizens consolidated, and patriotic volunteers worked hard on the citys defense. Their actions, and constant Russian violence, changed the leadership and made local authorities more patriotic,"" she said, adding that now, ""all former pro-Russian Odesans are ready to defend our city."" This is not how Moscow had planned it. On the eve of the war, one of the Kremlins ideologists, Sergei Markov, told The Daily Beast that Russian forces would take Odesa easily. ""There will be a quick Marine landing supported by a pro-Russian underground,"" Markov predicted of the development of the war on the Black Sea. Instead, Odesa became a symbol of resistance--and that pro-Russian underground melted away. As thousands of displaced people from neighboring Mykolaiv and Russian-occupied Kherson have flocked to the city, locals hung huge, patriotic banners with warning messages for potential saboteurs and spies. One of them showed a Ukrainian cutting a spys throat: ""Get ready, we know all your routes."" More banners in the district of Pushkinska and Bunin streets said, ""If somebody touches Mama Odesa, Mama will bury them."" Odesa also made the decision to get rid of all the street names of the ""aggressor country""--though it declined a petition, signed by 25,000 people, calling on Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelensky to demolish local monuments to Catherine the Great and Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The city said it was not the right time to discuss the pre-revolutionary monuments. Nevertheless, the citys mayor, Trukhanov, said it was cynical of Moscow to describe Ukraine as ""brother people"" but destroy it with missiles. ""Odesa has had losses in this war and we dont want to have anything to do with a state that is trying to eliminate our city, our country from the face of the Earth,"" the mayor said in a public statement last month. Now, even as Russia continues to bombard Odesa, there are signs of vibrant life everywhere. In the harbor, yachts rock gently in the late-afternoon sun--though they're all staying at the docks this season, because the Russians have planted mines in the surrounding waters. Still, the Yacht Club marina is bustling: on a recent Friday, musicians from the local opera and philharmonic theater performed a concert of Ukrainian songs for an audience of famous artists, writers, and accomplished businessmen, who in the early days of the war founded two powerful volunteer movements--called On the Wave, and Sandbox--to save their gorgeous, graceful city. They surrounded cultural monuments with sandbags, distributed armored vests, and welded tank barriers. Ukraine is preparing to ship 16 vessels full of grain to the Turkish port of Izmir ending a long economic drought for the city. Odessens were watching the smooth and bare Black Sea on Sunday. The first vessel with grain is scheduled to leave on Monday but many fear Russia might strike at the ships in spite of Moscows agreements with Turkey. ""Our favorite sea is like a battle field,"" Dmitro Botskevsky, a retired skipper, told The Daily Beast. ""Our military drone attacked Russian fleets headquarters today in Sevastopol, there are concerns about the safety of the passage for the grain, of course."" Local defense volunteers--led by the Yacht Clubs director, Albert Kobakov--grew more numerous as the war dragged on. Hundreds of activists joined. ""When the war began, I came here to show that I am not going to surrender,"" said local activist Maya Dimereli. She and Grodetskaya said that the biggest concern in the first week of the war was that the city authorities would betray Odesa and hand it over to Russia. Instead, Odesas businessmen felt committed to helping their city. From the owner of a perfume store, Dmitry Malyutin, to the founder of a tourist company, historian Aleksandr Babich, the citys elite opened their doors and supported the volunteers. ""If not for our society, I am not sure how long our resistance would have lasted. Their self-organization is fascinating and time plays against Putin--he is bombing Mykolaiv violently but Odesa is his problem,"" Sevgil Musaieva, editor-in-chief of Ukrainskaya Pravda, Ukraines legendary newspaper, told The Daily Beast. ""Politically we are winning the war--the entire world is supporting Ukraine."" Thousands of volunteers also signed up to be soldiers in the territorial defense units, since Odesa was keenly aware of the threat of a potential ambush by Russian forces from Transnistria on one side, and the advancing Russian army on the other. Captain Humeniuk, an officer of Ukraines State Border Guard Service and the voice of the administration of the defense forces in the southern region of Ukraine, told The Daily Beast that the city needed enough volunteers to fill one brigade--and instead got enough to fill three. So for the time being, Odesa lives in a state of wary hope. The chief commander of operations in the south, Maj-Gen Andriy Kovalchuk, has served in peacekeeping missions in Liberia and former Yugoslavia. Now Kovalchuk and other military authorities guard the city with care, explaining to its people why beaches have been mined and closed, and giving updates on the war twice a day. The citys restaurants and cafe verandas are crowded, and although air-raid sirens howl several times a day, on any given day, a visitor can hear a band singing Ukrainian songs on the central Deribasovskaya Avenue, and jazz music playing in the garden of the Tolstoy familys house. ""We are going to win this battle, like we did World War II"", vows a Russian-speaking theater director named Anna, whose Jewish family went through the Nazi invasion. Before this war, she liked to say she had a ""Russian soul."" But now she says: ""Odesa, the first Hero City of the USSR, will win this battle too""--but this time, against Moscow.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-managed-to-enrage-his-last-supporters-in-ukraine
['Julia Davis'],Team Putin Wakes Up: We Never Should've Laughed at Ukraine,2022-10-08 21:03:25,"""A war should be waged for real or not at all. Now we dont have any other options,"" Russian state TV host Sergey Mardan said following a series of losses.","Russia experienced a number of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine, but none of them were as humiliating as an explosion that rocked the Crimean Bridge, also known as Kerch Strait Bridge or Kerch Bridge, early Saturday morning. During his Saturday broadcast on Solovyov Live, Russian state TV host Sergey Mardan opened his show with heavy sighs. He noted, ""All day long well be talking about how this happened and what will come of it. I can tell you right now that nothing good will come of it, thats for sure."" Mardan grimly concluded: ""Theyve achieved an enormous propagandistic effect."" Repeatedly referring to Ukrainians with an often-used slur, Mardan complained that Russia apparently underestimated not only them, but also the Americans. Chauvinistic disregard for the Ukrainians as Russias ""lesser"" opponents manifests in the way Russian propagandists tend to blame the West for any painful blows inflicted in the course of Russias ill-fated invasion. Mardan noted: ""There was no shock that they would try to attack the Crimean bridge, but there was an initial shock that they managed to pull it off, especially in the early morning hours."" He explained that--as usual--the West is to blame: ""Many competent people explain that this was a complicated task--not just journalists or commentators, but specialists. There is a high level of certainty that an operation of this magnitude could have been staged only by Western intelligence agencies."" Mardan urged the Russians to stop underestimating the Ukrainian Armed Forces, bristling even at the comparisons to ISIS. He asserted: ""Comparing Ukraine to ISIS is insulting to the Russian Army, which has been fighting them on an enormous front for seven months... ISIS are tribespeople in sandals made out of tires. They have no cities, power plants, railways or factories. Ukraine has it all. Ukraine is a cruel, motivated, well-prepared enemy. This is an enemy nation that has been waging a full-fledged war against us for at least seven and a half months. We keep calling it a special military operation, but they are waging war... Good Lord, I cant keep listening to this thick and sticky rhetoric, its time to stop talking about the peace process and the collective West. This rhetoric doesnt look good--in fact, its harmful. Since the mobilization has been announced, were talking about war, a peoples war."" Mardan predicted an escalation, quoted Vladimir Lenin and urged a harsh response: ""We stand on the precipice of another escalation. Its unavoidable... A war should be waged for real or not at all. Now we dont have any other options... No one will allow us to retreat, even though some would like that--and actually want that to happen. We should have no illusions about that."" He somberly revisited fantasies harbored by many Russians in the very beginning of the invasion, stoked by top propagandists on state television, who predicted that a war against Ukraine would be fast, pain-free and nearly bloodless. That dream rapidly evaporated and reality hit hard, affecting even the staunch supporters of Putins war. Mardan reminisced: ""During the first week, we had a naive expectation of another ""Crimean miracle,"" like it happened in 2014. There we were, at Kyivs door, having solved all problems... That hope was gone 1-2 weeks later."" Mardan grumbled about the problems Russia continues to have with supplying its existing forces, especially in light of the recently announced partial mobilization. He outlined the well-known shortages of uniforms, drones and basic gear, which have been replenished through donations and crowdfunding. The host noted that at this point, every grandma in Russia knows what a quadcopter is, having had to contribute funds to supply the Army. Now the citizens are being prepared to skip New Years celebrations, to do without Christmas trees or fancy lights adorning city centers--with that money to be sent to the front, securing winter uniforms for the troops. Mardan sternly noted: ""This is no time to celebrate."" He also revealed that not everyone is as receptive to the idea of an indefinite war against Ukraine as Russian public polls alleged. Behind the scenes, many are anxious for the armed conflict to be over. In light of this rapidly growing trend, state TV propagandists have been tasked with convincing the public that unless Russia wins, its citizens would be locked ""in concentration camps,"" enslaved by the West or killed. Mardan said, ""After the mobilization, I noticed the growth of pacifist inclinations in my circles, among the people of my generation or older. Very cautiously, theyre starting to come out and say how nice it would be if everything came to an end, since were not pulling through."" The host proposed that the best strategy to shut down those inclinations was to vividly paint what the future of Russia would look like if its defeated in this war. He suggested, ""We should be painting the image of defeat with the same colors we used to describe the impending victory back in March, when we were planning a parade on Khreshchatyk [the main street of Kyiv]. I was dreaming about those scenes, as well as some of my colleagues."" Mardan invited his guest, political commentator Evgeny Norin, to specify what Russias defeat would look like. Norin ushered in the historical memories of Russias distant past. He opined: ""Russias defeat would resemble the Mongol yoke, with a modern technological twist... Crimea, Donbas and other contested regions would be taken away, just to put us in our place. From the standpoint of national humiliation, we would be forced to give up Sevastopol. Remember the fate of Serbia and Yugoslavia, who had to give up all of their military and political elites. Of course, many people here would say, 'So theyll cut off their heads, no big deal. Our soft pacifists say exactly that... Naturally, wed also be forced to pay an enormous amount of reparations, huge amounts would be taken."" Mardan and Norin concurred that Russian oligarchs and major companies would find a way not to pay and the cost of reparations would land on everyday citizens. Norin mused that Russia would not be allowed to manufacture anything that is more sophisticated than a foot stool and Western companies would lure away all of the specialists--much as theyre already doing. He predicted: ""After the capitulation, we would be unable to offer them anything aside from the joy of standing by your Motherland."" Norin darkly predicted that Russias capitulation ""would be like Yugoslavia on steroids,"" with decolonization as ""a cherry on top."" He said Russia would be forced to break up into at least 10 separate parts, with Sharia law being instituted in at least some of them. During the same show, State Duma member Alexander Kazakov offered a cheerful imperialistic prediction of what will happen if Russia perseveres and prevails: ""If we win, well take back whats ours and whatever is theirs as well.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-state-tv-host-sergey-mardan-says-ukraine-has-been-underestimated

Now some experts say they may have been tricked into losing limbs for bogus ""scraps of paper.""","Russian inmates who were yanked out of prison to fight in Ukraine have begun receiving their promised ""'pardons"" for taking part in the war--but legal experts say the supposed pardons are actually bogus. The news comes as Russias war effort grew increasingly deranged this week as the prison-recruiting tactic apparently became the official new modus operandi. The Wagner Group, a private military force linked to the Kremlin and run by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, had for weeks been visiting prisons across Russia to lure convicted murders, robbers, and even a cannibal to join the war against Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry, after taking heat for a series of battlefield defeats in recent weeks, then decided to throw their hat in the ring and create their own ""special forces unit"" made up of inmates from some of the same prisons Wagner had targeted, according to the investigative outlet iStories. The new unit, called ""Storm,"" is said to offer inmates the same conditions as Wagner: a six-month contract, payment, and a pardon. But propaganda footage shared by a media group linked to Wagner founder Prigozhin has sparked suspicions that the pardons may not be entirely legit. In the video released by RIA FAN, several freed inmates are seen receiving medals for their military service. At least three of the four pictured in a Luhansk hospital are missing parts of their limbs. ""With soldier's blood and soldiers sweat, you earned this pardon. Nobody gave it to you, nobody brought it. You earned it yourself. Precisely for participation in battles and displaying heroism,"" a man off-camera can be heard telling the men. The men look less than enthused as they are presented with what is described as a certificate of achievement from the Russian Defense Ministry, a commemorative Wagner token, and certificates confirming their pardons. Stanislav Bogdanov, one of the men interviewed in the propaganda video, proudly noted that he was ""grateful"" to Wagner for helping him find his purpose in life. ""Maybe I was created for something else, and not just to serve a sentence and sit there all my life,"" he said. Bogdanov admitted that he had no military experience prior to enlisting with Wagner. But he was exactly the kind of recruit Prigozhin had reportedly sought out: a convicted murderer (found guilty of murder with ""extreme brutality."") Bogdanov bludgeoned a judge to death in 2012 using an iron poker and dumbbells. He was sentenced to 23 years in a maximum security prison, and had served only 10 of them when Wagner recruiters released him to help kill civilians in Ukraine. Now having avoided serving the remaining 13 years, Bogdanov told the propaganda outlet he feels like hes been given a ""second"" shot at life. But it appears he and the other inmates may have been duped. ""Some nobody is handing the convicts papers and medals, telling [two of them] that these are pardon certificates. And the [others] that these are certificates of release. But they look like worthless scraps of paper with somebodys stamp,"" said Olga Romanova, the head of Rus Sidyashchaya (Russia Behind Bars), a human rights group that works closely with inmates. Romanova noted in a statement on Telegram on Wednesday that the process for issuing pardons is much more complicated than just handing out pieces of paper. ""Only the president can pardon, and this procedure is complicated and begins with the pardon commissions of regional public chambers... Regional public chambers have not not considered anything, no petitions for clemency. So what kind of papers are being handed to the convicts-who knows,"" she wrote. Gulagu.net, another human rights group specializing in the treatment of prison inmates, called the propaganda video proof of ""the merging of the mafia and the Russian state"" and noted that the pardons were apparently ""backdated.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/pardons-given-to-russian-inmates-who-lost-limbs-in-ukraine-war-are-allegedly-worthless
"['Dan Ladden-Hall', 'News Correspondent']",Putin's Annexation Plans Ripped up as Ukraine Smashes Russian Defensive Line,2022-10-04 13:56:53,Kyivs troops broke through Russian defenses in areas that Moscow claims to command.,"Russian President Vladimir Putins plans to annex four huge regions of Ukraine continued to falter Tuesday after Kyivs forces smashed their way through Russian defenses in the south of the country, claiming their biggest breakthrough in the region since the invasion began. Ukrainian fighters also seized more land in their continuing offensive in east Ukraine, retaking areas that the Kremlin claims are now part of the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian militarys southern operational command said 31 Russian tanks and one multiple rocket launcher had been destroyed Monday night, while a Russian-installed leader in the region acknowledged that Ukrainan troops had captured several villages along the strategically important Dnipro River earlier in the day. The major breakthrough comes after Ukrainian soldiers advanced in two of the four occupied regions which Putin last week annexed following sham referendums. The land grab--which has been condemned as illegal under international law--has been bolstered in Moscow by a shambolic military draft of 300,000 new troops and an alarming round of nuclear threats. Vladimir Saldo, the Kremlins puppet leader in occupied areas of Kherson--one of the annexed regions--told Russian state television that Ukrainian forces had recaptured the town of Dudchany along the Dnipro River. ""There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces,"" Saldo added. The town is around 20 miles south of where the front was situated before the breakthrough, suggesting the fastest advance of Kyivs troops in the south. Before the development, Russian soldiers had been dug into fortified positions along a mostly stationary line since the early days of the war. The advance of Ukrainian troops is hitting vital supply lines for up to 25,000 Russian soldiers positioned on the Dnipros west bank, with Russian soldiers already being forced to use makeshift crossings after Kyiv destroyed the rivers main bridges. ""Its tense, lets put it that way,"" Reuters claims Saldo said on Russian state television. ""The fact we have broken through the front means that... the Russian army has already lost the ability to attack, and today or tomorrow it could lose the ability to defend,"" Oleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv, told Reuters. The latest breakthrough comes after Moscow was humiliated by the loss of Lyman, the main Russian stronghold in the north of Donetsk. Donetsk--along with Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia--had been officially annexed at a Kremlin ceremony only hours earlier. Russian authorities held a concert in Moscows Red Square to celebrate the annexation even as its soldiers were being kicked out of the claimed land. ""The 'annexation of [these] territories exists only in Russian virtual TV reality,"" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, The Guardianreports. ""What will be more painful for the apologists of the 'Russian world will be [their] meeting with reality and the Ukrainian armed forces.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-annexation-plans-ripped-up-as-ukraine-smashes-russian-defensive-line
"['Allison Quinn', 'News Editor']",Russian Infighting Peaks With Calls for Suicide and Execution,2022-10-06 17:47:10,"Putins loyalists are publicly trash-talking each other, his soldiers are revolting, and nearly a million citizens have fled.","Just over two weeks since Vladimir Putins latest hail mary in his war against Ukraine, things are going so well for the Russian leader that draftees are rioting, his top allies are at each others throats over a series of losses, and his defense minister has now been urged by his own team to blow his brains out. ""Yes, really, many are saying that... a defense minister who allowed such circumstances to arise could, as an officer, just shoot himself. But, you know, for many the word 'officer is not clear,"" one of Russias puppet leaders in Kherson said Thursday in the latest sign of the wheels falling off the Russian war machine. Kirill Stremousov now joins a rapidly growing list of Putin loyalists openly venting about recent Russian failures on the battlefield--and blaming ""worthless"" Russian military brass for the humiliating debacle. After weeks of complaints by pro-Kremlin military bloggers, anger at the military has now officially carried over into a more formal setting: even some Russian lawmakers are now lashing out at defense officials, with retired army officer Andrei Kartapolov on Wednesday demanding the army ""stop lying"" about war losses. Propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, interviewing Kartapolov, suggested the ""only solution"" would be to execute the defense officials ""guilty"" of the mounting setbacks. The very public infighting could not come at a worse time for the Kremlin, as Ukraines eye-popping counteroffensive to reclaim the countrys land has already forced Russian troops out of territories Putin boasted were officially now part of Russia just days ago. The meltdown also comes, quite fortuitously, just in time for the Russian presidents birthday on Friday, which the Kremlin says he will spend in his hometown of St. Petersburg, more than 800 miles from Belgorod--the scene of the latest episode showing that Putins ""partial mobilization"" is going, quite spectacularly, not according to plan. Just two weeks after Putin announced to all of Russia that he would be summoning hundreds of thousands to face likely death on the battlefield to stop the West from ""weakening"" and ""dividing"" the country, his own troops are clearly divided: video has emerged of draftees straight-up rioting over the dysfunctional call-up, and more than a hundred of them are now said to have refused to fight. An estimated 500 draftees were filmed in Belgorod trashing Putins chaotic ""partial mobilization"" this week in a video widely shared by social media channels linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group puppet master who human rights groups say personally recruited hundreds of prison inmates to fight in Ukraine in order to ""win this damn war"" for Putin. ""Nobody needs us, there is absolutely zero preparation!"" one of the draftees can be heard shouting in the video. As if the footage of Russian troops deriding their own leaders was not bad enough, the video was also widely seen as evidence of further infighting between Putin loyalists behind the scenes, as several men seen in the video were donning Wagner insignia. The video immediately sparked suspicions that Prighozin himself may have leaked it in order to further smear top Russian defense officials hes openly criticized for recent war failures, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. That theory appeared to gain traction as news broke that Alexei Slobodenyuk, a staffer for one of Prigozhins media projects known for attacking Shoigu, was arrested by a spetsnaz unit in Moscow. But similar scenes have played out elsewhere, and even new legislation threatening deserters with up to 10 years in prison has apparently not deterred Russian draftees from opting out of the war. More than 100 newly mobilized troops from Bryansk are now said to be refusing to go to the front. ""Where are they sending us? We have no experience, we have nothing,"" an unnamed draftee said in an interview with the news outlet Sota published Thursday. The soldier said military leadership intends to send him and roughly 100 others who are refusing to fight to take back Lyman in the Donetsk region, from where Russian troops were forced to retreat last weekend. ""About a hundred and something people were sent there [before] and one remains alive, hes in a hospital,"" the soldier said. Apart from refusing to fight, many of the new troops Putin mobilized also appear to be more busy devouring each other than ""defending the Motherland"" as the Russian leader hoped. Residents in the Moscow regions city of Serpuhkov are afraid to leave their homes as draftees drunkenly fight in the streets; draftees in Penza beat up a lieutenant-colonel accused of calling them ""meat"" for the slaughter; and draftees and conscripts engaged in a mass brawl near Moscow that required police intervention, according to Mozhem Obyasnit. At least 10 Russian draftees have died before even making it to the frontline, according to local media reports. Those already on the battlefield are also revolting, according to human rights group Rus Sidyashaya, which revealed Thursday that 13 soldiers hijacked defense ministry vehicles and fled from a military base in occupied Kherson with weapons and ammunition in tow. And thats to say nothing of the nearly 700,000 citizens who fled the country after Putins mobilization order, according to a new report by Forbes Russia. In the face of such losses, however, the Kremlin appears to prefer sticking to what it does best: playing dumb. ""I dont even know what the Russian publication Forbes is,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday when asked about the mass exodus. ""Is it published? Is there even such a publisher?""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-infighting-in-ukraine-war-peaks-with-calls-for-suicide-and-execution

At least 14 people were killed and 100 were wounded in Russian missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine in what President Vladimir Putin confirmed was a reprisal for the attack on a key bridge that connects Russia to occupied Crimea. That blast Saturday, interrupting a crucial re-supply route for the Russian army in the south of Ukraine, was a symbolic and logistical hammer blow to Putins efforts to keep hold of illegally annexed Ukrainian territory. ""If attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on our territory continue, the measures taken by Russia will be tough and in their scale will correspond to the level of threats posed to the Russian Federation,"" Putin said in a threatening video address Monday. ""No one should have any doubt about it."" The strikes came hours before one of Putins closest allies, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, announced that a number of troops from the countrys 60,000-strong army will deploy alongside Russian troops, claiming that Ukraine had been secretly planning to attack Belarus. Without providing evidence, Lukashenko said he had been informed of the potential strikes ""through unofficial channels"" and that plans were already in motion. ""I must inform you that the formation of this group has begun. Its been going on for, I think, two days. I gave an order to start forming this group,"" the Belarusian leader said, according to the BelTA news agency. ""I have already said that Ukraine today it is not just discussing but planning strikes on Belarusian territory,"" he said. ""The process has begun. They [Ukraine] are being pushed by their patrons to unleash a war against Belarus in order to draw us in it and deal with Russia and Belarus at a time."" Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin claimed the Belarus plans were simply defensive. ""We dont intend to fight you. We dont want to wage a war with either Lithuanians or Poles or even more so with Ukrainians. If you dont want to either and if you dont take wrong steps, then there will be no war."" Air raid sirens sounded throughout the Ukrainian capital in the wake of the airstrikes, which represent the most serious attack on the city since Russian tanks first rumbled over the Ukrainian border in February. The capital's streets were filled with flames and emergency service crews. Reports suggest at least four missiles hit the city--one of which landed near a childrens playground, in a chilling re-run of a strike on a separate Kyiv playground in June. Following Putins televised address, Russias defense ministry added that the wave of airstrikes had ""achieved its goal"" and that all its targets of ""military command, communications, and energy facilities"" had been hit. At least 14 regions in total were struck on Monday, with widespread blackouts and other utility issues reported in the aftermath of the Russian attacks. Missile strikes were reported in Lviv, Ternopil, and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, as well as in Dnipro in central Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said energy infrastructure had been targeted across the country. Zelensky claimed a total of 84 Russian cruise missiles and 24 drones had been launched, of which 56 were shot down by Ukrainian air defenses. At least 70 infrastructure sites were damaged, 29 of which have been deemed critical. Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to Zelensky, said the strikes had no ""practical military sense"" and that Russias goal was to cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" In a speech, Zelensky pointed to the timing of Mondays attacks, saying Russia ""chose such a time and such targets on purpose to inflict the most damage."" Sharing a picture of the fiery aftermath of one of the blasts in Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko tweeted: ""Just minutes from my home. Just 20 minutes ago. What is Russia trying to hit? The national university? The park? Or the playground?"" ""Cowards fighting playgrounds, children and people,"" Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidents office, wrote on Telegram. ""This is another signal to the civilized world that the Russian question must be solved by force."" Emergency service crews were photographed tackling the blaze at the scene of one strike at an intersection near the citys center. Windows at Kyivs Taras Shevchenko University were shattered, and vehicles near the blast crater were reportedly totalled by shrapnel. Harrowing videos shared on social media show civilians narrowly avoiding the missiles which tore through the city, including one at the pedestrian bridge of the Arch of Freedom of the Ukrainian people. Residents who were in Kyiv at the time of the missile strikes Monday morning have spoke out about their grim sense of deja vu as the capital once again came into the the Kremlins crosshairs. Art curator Natalia Zabolotna was on the 16th floor of her apartment building when she heard the first explosion in the city center. ""This is worse than on February 24th,"" she told The Daily Beast, referring to the day when the invasion began. ""They fire every 15 minutes at the center of Kyiv and I heard sounds of an airplane engine."" Zabolotna grabbed her dog and ran downstairs to her car. ""My gas tank is full but I have no idea what to do and where to drive,"" she added. ""The entire country is on fire."" Hayane Avakian, the editor of Svoi.City, was in the metro heading to work when blasts tore through Kyivs university district. ""Everything in Ukraine is a target now,"" Avakian told The Daily Beast. As she continued on to her office, Avakian saw dark columns of smoke rising over the city blocks and broken glass lining the sidewalks below. ""Russians are attacking us from all directions,"" she said. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to send advanced air systems to Ukraine in a call with President Zelensky on Monday after the devastating missile strikes. ""He expressed his condemnation of Russias missile strikes across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, and conveyed his condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured in these senseless attacks,"" a White House statement said. The strikes come after a huge explosion partially destroyed the Crimean Bridge over the Kerch Strait on Saturday, the day after Putins 70th birthday. Over the weekend, the Russian leader described the attack on the 12-mile, $3.6 billion bridge ""an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure."" He added that the strike on Europes longest bridge--which left three dead-- had been devised and executed by the Ukrainian security services. While Ukraine did not claim responsibility for the attack, its senior figures celebrated the news. The bridge, which was opened in 2018 after Russias annexation of Crimea four years earlier, symbolically and strategically emphasized Moscows control over the contested peninsula. ""Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelensky, tweeted after the bridge bombing. Ahead of a meeting of Putins National Security Council, senior Kremlin figures vowed to avenge the bombing. ""Russia can only respond to this crime by directly killing terrorists, as is the custom elsewhere in the world,"" former President Dmitry Medvedev, who runs the council, said ahead of the meeting, according to state media agency Tass. ""This is what Russian citizens expect."" The same day the bridge was attacked, Putin appointed the notorious General Sergei Surovikin to take command of the Ukraine offensive. The former head of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Surovikin has built a reputation for ruthlessness over the course of a blood-soaked career. He led Russian forces in Syria in 2017, where indiscriminate airstrikes and attacks on hospitals appalled human rights organizations, but the Kremlin saw fit to make him a Hero of the Russian Federation, the nations highest honor. Hes also known for breathtaking brutality against his own countrymen. During the August Coup in Moscow in 1991, Surovikin led a rifle division to smash through barricades set up by pro-democracy protesters. Three were killed during the violence, including one man crushed to death, but Surovikin was ultimately not charged for the deaths. He was later found guilty of illegally selling weapons, though the conviction was eventually overturned. ""For over 30 years, Surovikins career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality,"" British intelligence officials wrote in a recent report. As well as the strikes on Monday, Russian shelling overnight destroyed an apartment building in the city of Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said. At least one person was killed and another five were injured in the strike, officials said. The city--which has never been captured by Russian forces but is the capital of one of four regions Putin recently claimed to have annexed--has been hit by shelling attacks for several days. On Sunday, 13 people died and 87 others were injured when another apartment building was hit, Ukrainian officials. Ten children were among the wounded in the attack, which President Zelensky called ""absolute evil."" ""Our courage will never be destroyed by terrorists missiles, even when they hit the heart of our capital,"" Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov said Monday.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/wounded-putin-takes-frustration-out-on-kids-playground-in-kyiv-missile-strikes

A report Friday--which is Putins 70th birthday--said that one of the despots closest allies had openly challenged the disastrous way the war was being conducted. The landmark challenge was even significant enough to be included in U.S. President Joe Bidens daily intelligence briefing, according to anonymous officials cited by the Washington Post. Although the individual who voiced the dissent was not identified, their discontent was said to center around mistakes being made by those directing the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. ""Since the start of the occupation we have witnessed growing alarm from a number of Putins inner circle,"" a Western intelligence official told the Post. ""Our assessments suggest they are particularly exercised by recent Russian losses, misguided direction and extensive military shortcomings."" Analysts of the war dont have to look far to find examples of such shortcomings, with embarrassing battlefield blunders clocking up at a rate as alarming as the number of Russians currently seeking to dodge Putins draft by fleeing the country. As well as the embarrassing leak from U.S. officials, British intelligence also gave Putin an unwelcome birthday surprise with a mind-blowing report on the staggering number of captured Russian tanks and armored vehicles currently being used by Ukraine. ""Repurposed captured Russian equipment now makes up a large proportion of Ukraines military hardware,"" the report from the U.K.s defense ministry said. ""Ukraine has likely captured at least 440 Russian Main Battle Tanks, and around 650 other armored vehicles since the invasion. Over half of Ukraines currently fielded tank fleet potentially consists of captured vehicles."" ""The failure of Russian crews to destroy intact equipment before withdrawing or surrendering highlights their poor state of training and low levels of battle discipline,"" the report added. The Kremlins latest ignominies come after a series of crushing military setbacks in Ukraine, which has seen Moscows forces kicked out of key areas in territory that Putin is claiming to formally control after signing treaties to annex huge swathes of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. Having plunged his nation into chaos and sparking fears about nuclear weapon use the world over, Putin is said to be working on his birthday this year where he would have once spent the day with an old comrade fishing in Siberia.

As the war dragged on, they continued to claim that Volodymyr Zelenskys government was about to fall. Faced with Ukraines mounting counteroffensive, which is rapidly achieving impressive gains, Russian propagandists are now describing an enormous horde, armed with the best Western weaponry and swimming in foreign specialists. With state TV studios full of doom and gloom, prominent pundits and experts seem to be preparing Russian audiences for future losses of occupied Ukrainian lands, which are being painstakingly reclaimed by the Ukrainian military. During Wednesdays broadcast of the state TV show 60 Minutes, host Evgeny Popov said: ""We wish courage to our warriors, who are indeed doing very important work, they are resisting an enormous horde that has been trained in the West."" Evgeny Buzhinsky, a retired Lieutenant-General of the Russian Armed Forces, claimed that the Ukrainian military is overflowing with American participants: ""There are not only advisers, but specialists. I think that there are thousands of American advisers and specialists on the ground in Ukraine, theyre probably present in every unit."" During his Wednesdays radio show, Full Contact, top Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov--with a noticeably bruised face--surmised: ""Im worried. Naturally, we want for our guys to crush [the other side] and only to advance, but life doesnt work that way."" Solovyov refused to address the source of his injuries, but in light of Ukrainian military gains, his bruised ego was likewise on full display. By the time his nightly program The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov started, the hosts facial abrasions had been covered with makeup. Speaking to State Duma deputy Andrey Gurulyov, who is a former deputy commander of Russia's southern military district, Solovyov attempted to downplay his initial reaction to Russias recent losses. ""Comrade Lieutenant General, you always speak so beautifully and convincingly. Calm people down, because there are all sorts of rumors. I can only imagine what would happen if Telegram existed in 1942-1943,"" he said. Gurulyov grimly replied: ""Today, I believe there is a difficult situation on one of our fronts. Yes, Ukrainians concentrated their assault troops there and started to advance."" Hemming and hawing, Gurulyov added: ""Well need some time to bring things back to order. Yes, the situation isnt easy. Were mistakes made? Yes, probably so. You cant avoid mistakes in life or in war."" Solovyov warned that no matter what, there would be no peace deal with Ukraine: ""There wont be a Minsk-3... The frontline can breathe, there can be local failures, there could be excited screams coming from Kharkiv and Kyiv. That wont change our general hard line... well suffocate this serpent. There are no other options... Well bury as many of them as we need to."" Appearing on Solovyovs show, military expert Mikhail Onufrienko threw aside the term ""special military operation"" and complained: ""This is a difficult war, its a big war, the world hasnt seen wars of this magnitude since WWII, at least after Vietnam... The panic is being stoked not by the Ukrainian side, not by the Kyiv regime or Western sources, but by our own patriotic [social media] channels... Nonetheless, objectively speaking, this is the most successful advance of the junta since February 24... We clearly dont have enough troops to contain them... but they couldnt take Balakliya."" Pro-Kremlin propagandists have lost that bit of joy as well, given that as of Thursday, Ukraine has retaken Balakliya--a strategically important city. During a briefing in Kyiv, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov said that Ukraine had retaken about 700 square kilometers of territory in both the east and south of the country. During Thursdays airing of 60 Minutes, Apti Alaudinov, the commander of Ramzan Kadyrovs Chechen detachment ""Akhmat,""""revisited his routine portrayal of Russias war as a battle against the Antichrist.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly ordered Russian forces to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk region by Sept. 15. Russia will be attempting to shift its third Army Corps to handle the Donetsk shift, the Deputy Chief of the Main Operational Directorate, Oleksiy Gromov, said Thursday, according to Interfax. ""We are considering the issue that directly with the participation of this unit there will be an attempt to conduct offensive operations in Donetsk direction,"" Gromov said. ""The enemy continues to hold the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, and Mykolaiv regions, and is also trying to create favorable conditions for the resumption of the offensive."" But the new army corps that Russia wants to send to Donetsk to overpower Ukrainian forces isnt necessarily the most impressive force. In recent days Russia has tried to gin up the new group of fighters by nixing an age limit for recruits and even recruiting prisoners, so that they can beef up their numbers, according to a senior U.S. defense official. ""Russia has already begun trying to expand recruitment efforts to staff at least one volunteer battalion per federal district and to raise a new third Army corps. They've done this in part by eliminating the upper age limit for new recruits, and also by recruiting of prisoners,"" the senior U.S. defense official said in a briefing with reporters on Monday. ""Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit, and ill-trained. So what this all suggests to us is that any additional personnel Russia is able to muster by the end of the year may not, in fact, increase overall Russian...combat power."" Putins armed forces have been faltering since the beginning of the war. Some troops have taken to sabotaging Russian equipment. And Russia hasnt achieved major objectives in the war, either. Moscow aimed to take Donetsk by June but has not succeeded, according to the head of the Donetsk regional military-civilian administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Russia also failed to take Kyiv, the capital, and has not taken much ground since mid-summer. After several months of problems, Putin has tried to dismiss the idea that Russia has made full-force efforts to advance, only to fail. He warned in July that ""by and large, we have not started anything seriously yet."" But Russias goals to add 137,000 additional troops to its armed forces by January, too, are unlikely to prove helpful to Moscows war plan, the senior U.S. defense official said. ""This effort is unlikely to succeed,"" the official said. The news of Russias efforts to regroup comes after Russias top military official has announced that Russian forces are reaching a slow-down point in the war. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed just last week that Russian forces have been slowing their war effort in recent weeks. And in recent days, Russian forces have been facing more setbacks. As Ukrainian forces work to launch a counteroffensive in the south of Ukraine, to take back Kherson, a city that Russia captured in the early days of the war this year, Russian units are faltering, according to the Pentagon. ""Ukrainian military operations... have made some forward movement, and in some cases... in the Kherson region,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder told reporters in a briefing this week.

""A defeat has some meaning when you acknowledge it and draw new conclusions. And if you dont acknowledge it, all you get is another defeat, perhaps even more devastating.

We should understand that it might lead to the disintegration of the country."" "" Now its impossible to pull the wool over our eyes, pretending that everything is wonderful. "" Political scientist Sergey Mikheyev described recent developments in Kharkhiv as ""a serious failure,"" on the part of Russia. ""Call it 'regrouping' or whatever else... This is our most serious defeat during the last six months, and the most significant success of our adversary... Perhaps this failure is beneficial, because being so obvious, now its impossible to pull the wool over our eyes, pretending that everything is wonderful,"" he said. Mikheyev argued that failures would likely prompt ""serious people"" to make some ""radical decisions,"" like striking Ukraines civilian infrastructure--a move that is often praised on Russian state TV, with propagandists promoting the idea of causing a total blackout that would deprive all of Ukraine of roads, bridges, electricity and running water. State TV pundits concur that such measures are necessary because Russias Armed Forces cant keep up with the goals set by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Shakhnazarov noted: ""All of us are aware of the problems experienced by our Armed Forces. In my opinion, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were obviously unprepared for the magnitude of this war. Ukraines Armed Forces were prepared, theyve been training and getting ready for eight years."" Solovyov was unwilling to concede Russias defeat to the Ukrainian troops and claimed that American and British soldiers were covertly fighting in their ranks. ""In the process of preparing the battle-ready Ukrainian troops, it turns out theyve been rapidly turning darker in color and becoming fluent English speakers. Theyre becoming indistinguishable from the mercenaries... Some of them have a Southern drawl, others speak with a British accent. Stop pretending already,"" he said. The idea of being defeated by NATO, as opposed to this smaller neighboring country, seems to sweeten the pot for many of the Kremlins cheerleaders. Shakhnazarov complained that the patriotic mood in the country is being negatively undermined from within by a continued obsession with the Western lifestyle and entertainment: ""It starts with small things. Why are they showing American movies on our television? Eff me! I just want to say, eff me, why are you doing that? Its humiliating!"" The filmmaker urged for clarity in the ""political solution of the Ukrainian question."" While no one argued with Shakhnazarov about Russias defeat, the existence of the Ukrainian ethnicity was too much to bear for some of the Kremlins mouthpieces. Political analyst Dmitry Drobnitsky asserted: ""The recognition of the existence of the Ukrainian people is the biggest mistake in our Soviet history."" Shakhnazarov followed up: ""So there are no Ukrainian people?"" Drobnitsky replied: ""The Ukrainian people do not exist. Any historian will tell you that they dont exist... Youre offering me to recognize their existence. Thanks, but no thanks."" After objecting to arguments about the supposed non-existence of the Ukrainian ethnicity and the Ukrainian language, the Germany-based pundit Alexander Sosnovsky became visibly unsettled by what he was hearing. In a scene that resembled a Mitchell and Webb sketch, in which two Nazi officers come to the realization that they are the 'baddies in WWII, he bitterly concluded: ""I dont want to go any further, because this smells of nationalism.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-state-tv-declares-its-time-to-admit-serious-defeat-in-ukraine-war

A Twitter storm ensued.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk waded into Russias war in Ukraine Monday by tweeting that Ukraine should remain ""neutral"" in the war as a way to open the door to peace. ""This is highly likely to be the outcome,"" in Ukraine, Musk said. ""Just a question of how many die before then."" The callous comments, which come in Russias eighth month of unprovoked war on Ukraine, had tinges of Russian propaganda, raising questions about why Musk, a CEO--not a diplomat or politician--would even weigh in on the war. In his tweets, Musk added that a peace deal should include a recognition that Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, is ""formally part of Russia."" Ever since Russia invaded Crimea and conducted its sham referenda in Crimea, the United States and other allies have recognized the region as a part of Ukraine. The billionaires comments ignited a torrent of criticism online, including from Andrij Melnyk, Ukraines former Ambassador to Germany, who lashed out at Musk with expletive-laced insults about Musks business. ""Fuck off is my very diplomatic reply to you,"" Melnyk said in a Tweet. ""The only outcome [is] that now no Ukrainian will EVER buy your f...ing tesla crap. So good luck to you [sic]."" Musk also posted a poll asking Twitter users to weigh in on his suggestions. After a majority of respondents voted against the ideas, he blamed a ""bot attack"" for skewing the results. In the early days of the war, Russian and Ukrainian officials met to discuss potential paths to peace. Russias proposals included demands that Ukraine remain ""neutral"" and recognize Crimea as Russian--two of Musks suggestions Monday--as well as demilitarizing. But as Ukrainian forces defended against Russias onslaught, gaining momentum and confidence that they might be able to beat back Russian troops in the war and defend their country from takeover, the talks fell apart. Senior Biden administration officials have pointed out in the last several months that the war could end in peace if only Russia stopped the war and retreated from Ukraine. But a Ukrainian retreat would inevitably lead to Russia killing more Ukrainians and continuing with their goals to take over Ukraine. ""Negotiating with the Russian federation means... a fatal ending for everyone,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in August. What Musk is proposing, in essence, is that Russia be allowed carte blanche to rape and pillage throughout Ukraine, according to Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraines foreign minister. ""Those who propose Ukraine to give up on its people and land--presumably not to hurt Putins bruised ego or to save Ukraine from suffering--must stop using word 'peace as an euphemism to 'let Russians murder and rape thousands more innocent Ukrainians, and grab more land,"" Kuleba said. Zelensky himself weighed in Monday by posting his own ""poll"" to Twitter and asking if people preferred an Elon Musk who supports Ukraine, or one who supports Russia. Musk has previously weighed in on issues he appears to know little about, to dramatic effect. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, he repeatedly made contentious--or flat out wrong--pronouncements about the virus, including by declaring that kids were ""essentially immune"" to COVID-19. He also argued that the ""coronavirus panic is dumb"" and forecasted, very wrongly, that the United States would likely approach ""close to zero new cases"" by April 2020. As the pandemic raged on, Musk continued to poke at government officials over aggressive restrictions--which had complicated production at his electric carmaker Tesla. Last February he directed his ire overseas, tweeting (then deleting) a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler; Trudeau had been warring with a convoy of truckers over the countrys vaccine mandates. Over the years, Musk has separately caused major controversies across multiple other fronts: declaring inaccurately on Twitter in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private (triggering a $40 million fraud settlement with the SEC), wading into an effort to rescue children stuck in a Thai cave, and becoming an increasingly vocal champion of some Republican politicians. The billionaire has achieved greater success within the tech world. His satellite internet company Starlink has aided Ukrainian fighters in the field, while SpaceX, his rocket startup, is now worth more than $100 billion. But despite Musks poking and prodding for a negotiation over Russias war in Ukraine, peace talks appear far off at the moment. In recent days, as Russia has held more sham referenda in four regions in Ukraine and sought to illegally annex them, Zelensky has indicated there is no way to hold productive and genuine peace talks with Putin. ""This is clear and obvious,"" Zelensky said in an address last week. ""Russias implementation of the so-called Crimean scenario and another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory will mean that there is nothing to talk about with this President of Russia.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-told-to-fuck-off-by-ukrainian-diplomat-andrij-melnyk-after-russia-war-tweet
"['Allison Quinn', 'News Editor']",New War Losses Send Putin's Stooges Into Frantic Meltdown,2022-09-08 18:22:01,Russian propagandists are scrambling to respond to a slew of major territorial losses in Ukraine.,"As Ukrainians celebrated reclaiming a slew of territories, many Russian propagandists went into overdrive to cover the furthest thing they could from the war: the health of Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Thursday afternoon. The sudden shift came after pro-Kremlin Telegram channels seemed to grow increasingly frantic in recent days as Ukraine launched a surprise counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region, apparently taking advantage of Russias reallocation of forces to strike them when they were least expecting it. The refrain ""theres no panic"" flooded social media channels operated by the most staunch supporters of Russias war, even as video emerged of Russian forces being captured, the Ukrainian flag being raised in newly retaken towns, and Russian-backed authorities apparently closing up shop in areas now encircled by Ukrainian troops. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces finally revealed the results of its ambitious counter-offensive on Thursday afternoon: more than 270 square miles of land reclaimed in the east and south of the country, and more than 20 villages in the Kharkiv region back under Ukrainian control. Social media lit up with photos of Ukrainian soldiers proudly posing in front of signs in Shevchenkove, Borshchyvka, and Volokhiv Yar, areas where Russias military appeared to be confident they were in full control just a week earlier. Russian propagandists appeared to melt into some kind of existential tug-of-war as the news trickled out, with one well-known Telegram channel, Novorossiya Z.O.V. Militia Reports, sharing videos of the Ukrainian flag raised above Balakliya before insisting it meant nothing, citing a local resident who said the Russians ""left on their own,"" and then posting a survey asking followers, ""Is Queen Elizabeth still alive?"" Andrei Rudenko, a reporter for Russian state-run media who posts regular updates about the war, suggested perhaps a conspiracy was underway, asking if U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken flew into Kyiv on Thursday because the British queen died. ""Changes in global politics are possible ..."" he wrote. Vladimir Rogov, one of the Russian proxy leaders in the Zaporizhzhia region, also appeared to suddenly shift focus, posting on Telegram a lengthy writeup of how, among other things, the queens death will temporarily paralyze public transport on the day of her funeral. Tsargrad TV also joined in, declaring ""London bridge is falling down"" and posting a slew of reports on the queens dire health. Even as many preferred to shift to the queen, however, some pro-Kremlin channels openly admitted to Russias recent defeats on the battlefield--and raged over what they described as Russians being abandoned. ""Millions of Russians from Kherson to Kupyansk are now not in the least bit sure that Russia is with them --forever,"" read a post on the Zastavny Telegram channel acknowledging Russian losses. ""I am waiting for the correction of this tragic mistake,"" the post read.

"['Shannon Vavra', 'National Security Reporter']",Ukraine's Push to Take Back This City Could Make or Break the War,2022-07-30 01:36:08,"Ukrainian officials are planning to take back Kherson from Russian forces in a sweeping counteroffensive, but there are huge doubts about whether they are ready.","The war in Ukraine could be breaking out into a new phase in the coming days, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a make-or-break counteroffensive against Kherson, a key city which Russian forces have occupied since the early days of the war. Ukrainian forces have been preparing for weeks to to run an attack on Kherson, a key city in the south, close to Russias strongholds. The counteroffensive is ""gathering momentum,"" according to a British intelligence analysis issued Thursday. But some American officials and lawmakers are hesitant to say the Ukrainian forces are guaranteed a victory if they go all in now. Ukrainian forces have been preparing for a counteroffensive for some time now. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week his forces have been advancing towards Kherson ""step by step."" Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged civilians to evacuate the region to avoid the offensive earlier this month. And an adviser to Khersons government, Serhiy Khlan, has suggested that Kherson will definitely be liberated by September. The strategically important city is just a couple of hours drive from the Crimean peninsula which was seized by Russia way back in 2014. Creating a Russian stranglehold across the south of the country and wrecking Ukraines economy by cutting off access to the Black Sea as well as the Sea of Azov has been a key goal of Putins invasion. That twisted dream would be all but destroyed if Ukraine can re-take Kherson. But a Ukrainian success might hinge on western aid supplies, which Ukrainian officials say cant come fast enough--and failing in Kherson would be a devastating loss for Ukraine. But getting ahead of our skis would not be appropriate in advance of the assault--so much remains to be seen on the battlefield, warned Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA). ""Theres always a fog of war,"" Auchincloss, who has previously commanded infantry in Afghanistan, told The Daily Beast. ""You can never predict what happens after first contact."" Concerns abound about whether the Ukrainian forces are adequately prepared to take on the Russians in Kherson. Ukrainian officials have said they are going through between 5,000 and 6,000 rounds of artillery ammunition each day. Keeping up with that burn rate will change once the counteroffensive begins, and Ukraine might need three or four times that, according to The New York Times. Ukraines offensive weapons supply and preparation will be key to their ability to take back Kherson, too. But current preparation might not be enough, by some lawmakers count. As Ukrainians eye a counteroffensive, the Biden Administration should step up its efforts to provide more High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and to provide air support, such as fighter jets, to Ukraine that could be pivotal in securing a win, warned Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). ""The United States and our NATO allies and other democracies have provided tremendous support to the Ukrainian people--and I believe we need to provide more,"" Lieu, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Daily Beast. ""If we can give Ukraine additional advanced weapons such as advanced aircraft, and try to increase Ukraines air power, I think that will be immensely helpful to Ukraine."" Lieu said he continues to press the administration to follow through on promises to consider sending fighter jets to Ukraine. ""Hopefully they can do that sooner rather than later,"" Lieu said, referring to the Biden Administration. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, indicated that he is tracking the morale of Ukrainian fighters, and suggested that morale is in good shape. ""Morale remains high,"" Swalwell said. ""Thats the most important factor."" But Ukraines defense minister, Oleksi Reznikov, has discussed the need to raise up a million man-strong army to take back southern territory Russian forces have seized. And Ukrainian leadership openly admit they still need more help to properly back their assault plans. Ukrainian political leaders have been pushing the United States military outpost in Germany to provide more equipment in recent days more quickly, according to The New York Times. The U.S. Defense Department says its working to keep up with demand, as Ukrainians need more reinforcements to be able to attack Russians in Ukrainian territory. ""We understand the urgency, and were pushing hard to maintain and intensify the momentum of donations,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week. Even so, Russia appears to be bolstering its defenses, in what appears to be a shift in strategy. In recent hours, amid warnings that Ukraine is preparing an offensive, Russia has already been redeploying forces to defend the south, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. There are, however, some indications Russia is down for the count, at least for now. Russia hasnt made any major gains since taking Lysychansk earlier this month. Russian forces in Kherson are ""virtually cut off"" from other Russian-occupied territories, according to the British intelligence analysis. Just Wednesday, Ukrainian forces used American-supplied HIMARS to bomb Antonivskyi Bridge, a key bridge over the Dnipro river by Kherson which has been crucial to Russian supply routes, said Kirill Stremousov, the deputy chief of the Russian administration for the Kherson region. And Russia, as in the early days of the war, is not doing well in terms of supplying the war in Ukraine, according to John Kirby, a White House National Security Council coordinator. ""His own defense-industrial base is having a hard time keeping up with his unprovoked war in Ukraine,"" Kirby told reporters last week. And although concerns remain that Russia is prepared to keep the fight grinding on, the Russian military doesnt appear prepared to keep up training and equipment to levels necessary for decisive wins, according to Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ). ""Russia can probably mobilize men but they cannot mobilize well-trained men and well-equipped men,"" Gallego, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told The Daily Beast. ""That puts Ukraine in a better position. I think its military probably is now on par or even better when it comes [to] their training with Russia."" Assessments from the U.S. intelligence community show that Russian forces have been significantly depleted since the war began. While estimates from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have pinned Russias troop losses at about 40,000, U.S. intelligence has pegged Putins troop losses at close to 75,000 since the war broke out in February, according to Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. And MI6 chief Richard Moore said last week at the Aspen security conference that the U.K. intelligence agency believes Russia will tire out in the coming weeks due a manpower shortage. All of the hurdles the Russian military is facing now, coupled with key weapons aid and intelligence support from the United States--which so far has helped Ukrainian forces go after Russian ammunition depots and other targets precisely--could lay the groundwork for a difficult but successful fight ahead for the Ukrainians. ""I have confidence that we are providing them with the weapons... and intelligence support that they need to precisely target Russian command and control and ammunition nodes,"" Auchincloss said.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukraines-big-gamble-to-retake-kherson-could-make-or-break-putins-whole-war
"['Shannon Vavra', 'National Security Reporter']",Kremlin Sources Slam 'Losing' Putin and His 'Dumpster Fire' War in Explosive Report,2022-10-07 19:41:14,Putins closest circles are airing their grievances more boldly than ever before--but the Russian leader isnt taking the hint.,"As Ukrainian forces continue to make gains against the Russian army, whispered grievances about Vladimir Putin have begun to fly around the Kremlin about the war and efforts to avoid celebrating his birthday, which falls on Friday. ""It quickly became clear that were better off not holding any celebrations right now--its not the time,"" one source close to the Kremlin told Meduza. ""Governors are even thinking about cutting back on this year's [winter] holiday celebrations; nobody has extra money lying around."" Its ""a sensible idea"" to avoid celebrating Putins birthday widely throughout Russia, one source from the administration told Meduza. Although many close to Putin fear him, they have lost respect for him, another source said. ""People are scared shitless around him,"" a source close to the Russian government told the outlet. ""But its fear without respect."" In some cases, Putin himself has begun to receive some grim critiques from within his inner circle about the direction he has taken the war. ""Every 48 hours, theres another dumpster fire--nobody really understands whats going on,"" a source close to the Kremlin told Meduza. ""The people responsible for actually implementing decisions dont hear about them until the last minute."" One member of Putins inner circle voiced disapproval of how the war is being conducted directly to Putin, according to intelligence provided to President Joe Biden in recent weeks, The Washington Post reported. Ramzan Kadyrov, a key Putin ally and Chechnyas leader, as well as Evgeniy Prigozhin, the head of Russias mercenary Wagner Group, have also been pillorying Putins war plans publicly. The mounting disarray in Moscow comes after a series of blows in Ukraine that have sent the Russian military spiraling out of control. In the last month alone, Ukrainians have waged counteroffensives against Russian forces, and have even been able to seize back territory that Russia has illegally annexed in an attempt to claim it as Russian. The Kremlin has even acknowledged this week that although it attempted to annex four regions in Ukraine and claim them as Russian, Moscow is not certain about where the borders of the regions lie. The stumbles have led Putin into a corner where he has failed to achieve his major objectives even though the war has dragged on for more than seven months. And although he has initiated a partial mobilization to try to replace those lost on the battlefield, he has alienated Russians who are against the war, prompting a massive exodus from the country, and even failed to adequately prepare conscripts for the conflict. ""He doesnt know how to lose,"" one source told Meduza of Putin. ""And he especially doesnt know how to admit hes losing."" Putin has also stopped leaning on his advisers to gauge the prudence of his plans, one source said. ""He would voice scenarios that he thought were likely and ask, 'What if we do this? What will the consequences be? And what if we do it this way? Then what?"" the source said. ""But thats stopped."" The sense of alarm over the way the war is going has been growing in recent days among Russian officials. The head of the lower house of parliament's defense committee, Andrei Kartapolov, publicly lashed out at Putin this week, warning him that he and the Kremlin ought to stop applauding Ukraines losses as if Russia is winning, and stop glossing over Russian defeats in Ukraine. ""The people know. Our people are not stupid,"" Kartapolov said. ""Stop lying."" Since February, Russia has lost 61,680 troops in the war, according to a tally issued Friday from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Biden himself has openly begun opining on what it would be like for Putin to lose power in Russia, as the Russian president has been issuing nuclear saber-rattling threats for weeks now. Its the ""first time since the Cuban missile crisis we have the threat of a nuclear weapon if, in fact, things continue down the path they are going,"" Biden said Thursday. ""We are trying to figure out, what is Putins off-ramp... Where does he find himself in a position that he does not only lose face but lose significant power within Russia?"" His comments came just a week after Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraines deputy intelligence chief, warned that the risk of Russia using a tactical nuclear weapon was ""very high."" The United States has not seen any reason to adjust Americas nuclear posture and hasnt seen indications from Russia that Moscow is preparing imminently to use nuclear weapons, the State Department clarified Friday. ""The presidents comments... reinforce how seriously the administration takes these threats,"" said Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson at the State Department.

The newest tranche of sanctions punishing Russia for its illegal annexation of four Ukrainian provinces wont turn the tide in the war, administration officials said on Friday, but are the safest way to continue backing the Ukrainian resistance without risking direct American involvement. ""The sanctions element of our strategy, the economic pressure that we are placing on Russia, and the denial of their ability to gather what they need to be able to regenerate their war machine, this has been a critical element to how we have prosecuted our strategy so far,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters in the White House briefing room. ""The impacts of it will continue to be felt month on month as we go forward and put us in a stronger position, and Russia in a more disadvantaged position."" Sullivans remarks came hours after the Commerce, State and Treasury departments announced new economic, diplomatic and financial actions against Russia and its leadership in response to Putins announcement on Friday morning that four Ukrainian provinces are now Russian territory. ""People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever,"" Putin said in a speech from the Kremlin on Friday morning, naming the four Ukrainian provinces, which make up nearly one-fifth of Ukraines territory. The annexation--which is illegal under international law and was met with a range of sanctions, visa restrictions and other economic measures by allied governments around the world--was widely expected by U.S. officials in the months leading up to Putins announcement, though the debate over the Biden administrations response was a matter of internal dispute. "" Thats a B.S. answer. There is no more apt time to support fast-tracking NATO membership than when half the country has been stolen. "" ""What is a proportionate response to the illegal seizure of one-fifth of an allys territory?"" one senior U.S. official told The Daily Beast before a series of sham elections in the occupied provinces that were used to justify Putins annexation address. ""Russia waited seven years after annexing Crimea to mount another pretext-less invasion of Ukraine--without a proportionate response, whatever that looks like, there is no disincentive to discourage them from another invasion seven years from now."" In the first hours after the annexation, the administrations counteroffensive was focused primarily on the economic front: sanctions against the head of Russias central bank, more than two hundred members of Russias Federal Assembly, and on companies that feed Russias military supply chains. ""These sanctions will impose costs on individuals and entities--inside and outside of Russia--that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. ""We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable."" Despite those measures, the debate over a proportionate response continues, with some senior State Department officials pushing for the U.S. to more aggressively back Ukraines bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a proposal Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for and which Sullivan sidestepped. ""The best way for us to support Ukraine is through practical on-the-ground support in Ukraine,"" Sullivan said, adding that the question of hastening Ukraines entry into NATOs mutual-defense pact ""should be taken up at a different time."" ""Thats a B.S. answer,"" one senior U.S. diplomat told The Daily Beast when sent a transcript of Sullivans remarks. ""There is no more apt time to support fast-tracking NATO membership than when half the country has been stolen."" The U.S. support for Ukraines resistance is not entirely in the form of punitive measures taken against the Kremlin, of course. Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced an additional $1.1 billion in security assistance for the country, which includes artillery rocket systems, armored vehicles, drones and body armor, and Biden on Friday signed a stopgap spending bill that included nearly $12 billion in additional aid for Ukraine. But while limited military assistance for Ukraine has helped Kyiv make major gains in Eastern Ukraine against Russian forces, one national security official said, the White House and National Security Council are constantly aware that backing Putin into too tight a corner risks provoking increasingly desperate counter-responses. ""There are two apex priorities: 1) support Ukraines attempts to expel Russian forces and reclaim its occupied territory; and 2) do not do so in a way that sparks World War III,"" the official said. ""Those two priorities are not in definitional conflict, but the margin is narrowing."" One need only look at the apparent sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, the official said, as an indicator of how far Putin may go as the invasion falters and inexperienced Russian conscripts replace tens of thousands of dead soldiers on the front. The pipelines, which were discovered on Monday to have massive leaks of methane gas following underwater explosions, supplied nearly 20 percent of Europes natural gas before the invasion. The threat of continued implausibly deniable sabotage is far from the topmost concern, however. That would be Putins increasingly explicit threats of nuclear war in the event that Russian territory--which now includes much of Eastern Ukraine, at least in the Kremlins eyes--is threatened. Biden called the leaks a ""deliberate act of sabotage,"" although he later hedged on directly blaming the Russian government for an attack on the pipeline.

It is unclear how many fighters were injured or killed in the attack, thought to have been carried out over the weekend using a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which is made for the U.S. military and has been donated to Ukraine. ""There is no more Wagner HQ in Popasna,"" Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko wrote on Facebook, referring to the location of the camp in the Luhansk region of Russian-controlled Ukraine. ""Thank you, HIMARS and the Armed Forces of Ukraine!"" The Kremlin does not confirm the existence of the group, or its role as defined by Western intelligence sources, who say most of the fighters are recruited from Russian prisons. Some reports suggest that convicted murderers are being pardoned in exchange for six months of combat in Ukraine. The first news of the base camp location came on Aug. 8, when Russian propagandist war correspondent Sergei Sreda visited the site and posted selfies with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch famously known as ""Putins Chef"" who manages the elite paramilitary killers. Some reports Monday suggested that Prigozhin has not been heard from since he was spotted at the camp, but the suggestion that he was killed in the attack remains just a glimmer of hope by the Ukrainians. The photos posted by Sreda were undoubtedly meant to show a flex of Russias muscles, as reports of widespread casualties continue to counter Russian propaganda on the progress of the war. But instead, they inadvertently exposed key geo-markers, including a bomb shelter that Ukrainian forces recognized. The images were quickly removed from Telegram, but not before Ukrainian techies geolocated them with enough precision to launch the deadly attack. Several Russian Telegram channels confirmed the hit on Sunday, though details were vague about the true damage to the unit. Wagner fighters have been active in Crimea and the Donbas region since 2014, and have been deployed to back Putin allies and Russian interests in Syria, Libya, Mali, as well as the Central African Republic.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukraine-forces-say-they-wiped-out-elite-wagner-hq-in-donbas
['Tom Mutch'],Putin's New Ukraine Strategy Proves He Is Getting Desperate,2022-07-20 08:54:11,Putin believes firing missiles into towns across Ukraine will frighten the country into submission--despite the failure of his massive ground invasion. Its not working.,"VINNYTSIA, Ukraine--Smoke and flames rose from the wreckage of burning buildings as the screams of the wounded and dying filled the air. Here was more evidence of President Vladimir Putins growing desperation. Another 24 people--three of them children--paid the ultimate price for the Kremlins tragic new strategy. The Russian Army was too weak, ill-disciplined, and under-cooked to make the sweeping gains the Kremlin expected when they launched this illegal war on Ukraine. With the army bogged down and making incremental gains in the eastern Donbas regions, but offering little threat to the rest of Ukraine, Putin has resorted to launching missile strikes against civilian centers all over the country. The most recent major attack came on Thursday, when a Russian submarine launched Kalibr precision missiles into a concert hall and a medical center in Victory Square in the previously peaceful city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine. Katya, an employee of the next-door Nova Poshta post office, told The Daily Beast what it was like to become a pawn in Putins geopolitical tantrum. ""It was the middle of the day and we heard the air raid alarm and started to go to the shelter when the first missile hit buildings just over the street from us. Some of our colleagues were injured when the windows shattered, and the glass flew inside,"" she said. ""We could see cars on fire outside and smoke everywhere. Our building caught fire as well and we fled."" Colonel Yuri Ignat of the Ukrainian Air Force, who is a special adviser to the region on air defense, explained that this was no longer conventional warfare. ""This is a major terrorist strike by a terrorist state which is striking in peaceful areas and killing our people. What was their purpose, who did they want to hit, what did they want to do? Vinnytsia is not the first city where they kill innocent citizens."" "" Someone is no longer needed. Because they were already covered with a black cloth. "" -- Elena Kostakova While the Kremlin has made slow and painful but real gains in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, its military machine has ground to a halt in all other areas of the country. So instead, Putin has relied on his terrifying arsenal of long-range missiles to terrorize the civilian populations that remain out of range of his troops or artillery. He seems to believe he can weaken Ukraines resolve to fight. Since June, Ukrainian officials and international observers have noted a steady uptick in missile strikes causing large numbers of civilian casualties across the country. Two weeks ago, the Russian Air Force dropped three unguided Kh 22 bombs on Serhiivka, a small seaside town near the port city of Odesa, killing 22 Ukrainians. A few days before that, a strike hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, killing 19 people. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraines National Security Council, said in an interview with The Guardian: ""We have a system to monitor and track all airstrikes and other attacks in our country and what we have noticed recently is a tendency to destroy more and more civilian targets. They have decided to terrorize civilian population. Thats not my emotions but what our monitoring is telling us."" Elena Kostakova, a 68-year-old retiree, lived in the apartment block in Serhiivka that was destroyed by a strike. ""Everything happened so quickly,"" she told The Daily Beast. ""I heard the first explosion and ran out. And it saved my life. Because when the second explosion happened, everything flew: both windows and glass. It was terrifying. ""I saw the dead. Its very creepy. Very scary. People scream. They cry. They ask for an ambulance. The firefighters arrived. Fast too. And someone is no longer needed. Because they were already covered with a black cloth. It was very scary. But now the morning has come. Its time to clean the glass and get back to normal."" Despite the suffering Ukrainians continue to show the most remarkable resilience. When The Daily Beast arrived on the scene in Vinnytsia on the evening of the strike, the city authorities had already cleared much of the rubble. Residents of civilians homes could be seen from the street repairing broken walls and windows. Katya and her colleagues all had brooms and shovels to sweep up the mess in their offices and planned to be back at work the following week. Authorities were carting out the burned-out orange husks of cars on the back of pickup trucks. Among the 24 confirmed dead so far was 4-year-old Liza Dmitrieva, a young girl with Down syndrome, whose mother was taking her from a speech therapy class. An Instagram video posted by her mom shortly before the explosion showed a smiling and giggling young girl cheerfully pushing her stroller through town. Now a photo of her torso lying next to her pushchair has now become a symbol for Ukrainians of this new grisly phase of the war defined by senseless death from the sky. The Kremlin has consistently denied targeting civilians, claiming that it only aims for Ukrainian military facilities. These denials are very difficult to believe. There are no military facilities anywhere near Serhiivka, which is a town many miles from the front and of no strategic importance. In Vinnytsia, the Russian Naval Forces claim to have been targeting a meeting of Ukrainian Air Force commanders who were meeting with Western weapons suppliers. But Western arms dealers would constitute a legitimate military target and for this reason would almost certainly hold such meetings in a neighboring third country such as Poland. Instead, many Ukrainians believe that Putin is trying to send a message that everyone in the country is in danger while the country refuses to bow to Russias aggression. He would like to be able to put public pressure on Zelensky to sign away Ukrainian territory in the countrys east or to formally acknowledge Russias illegal annexation of Crimea. This would allow Putin to claim a victory to a domestic audience. By now, residents all over the country have had a brush with death. For Valentine Oleynik, a 26-year-old IT worker who commutes between Kyiv and Vinnytsia, last weeks strike was his second close call of the war. ""My old apartment was just a hundred meters away from the site of the impact. If I had taken the next train, I would probably have been driving through that square just when the rocket hit."" He shrugs and explains that his previous apartment block in Kyiv had been struck twice by missiles. ""The first time you hear an air raid siren you freak out and wonder what the hell is going on. But weve been hearing them all the time for months now, so no one really bothers to do anything anymore. We just try to live our lives as normally as possible."" He casually tells me that ""nowhere in Ukraine is safe."" He says this not in a despairing tone but in the way he might say that Odesa or Kyiv have the same chance of light rainfall that afternoon. ""Can you believe that back before 2014 we actually saw the Russians as our friends?! We thought that if anyone ever tried to hurt us from the West, they would be on our side. Now weve had eight years of war. I think Ukraine will win this war soon. But now peace is not enough for us. We want justice and we want to see the people who did all these terrible crimes punished for them."" Instead of forcing Ukrainians into submission, Putins terror campaign is hardening their resolve. In the destroyed center of Vinnytsias square is a replica of a World War II fighter plane--a memorial to the Soviet Air Force that helped defeat the Nazi armies. Back then Russian and Ukrainian troops fought as part of one army: now they tear each other apart on the most brutal battlefields Europe has seen since 1945. Several holes have been blown in the planes fuselage and wings by missile fragments, but the frame has held together. It looks like a bomber thats just returned from a daring bombing raid on Berlin. Standing underneath the monument, Colonel Ignat pointed at the wreckage and said, ""The Russians want to bring us to our knees, make us surrender, and wipe us out. But this will never happen, and with the worlds help, we know Ukraine will win.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-new-missile-strategy-proves-he-is-getting-desperate-in-ukraine
['Julia Davis'],Top Putin Crony Admits They Want 'to Grieve and to Panic' Over Ukraine,2022-10-03 13:12:26,Russian state TV can no longer put a brave face on the disaster they are facing in Ukraine.,"On the eve of President Putins self-proclaimed ""annexation"" of Ukraines regions, trouble was brewing in Russia--and everyone knew it. Social media was abuzz with the anticipation that Ukraines Armed Forces were about to reclaim Lyman from the Russian invaders. The mood in Moscow was a lot different than the 2014 celebration of the annexation of Crimea. Crowds that were bussed-in for the rally half-heartedly chanted ""hooray,"" and Putin himself seemed to be forcing the look of jubilation. Sergey Mardan, host of the radio show Saturday Mardan, openly questioned the propriety of organizing a celebratory concert during the same time when Russian troops were fighting, bleeding, and retreating from Ukraines Lyman. Appearing on Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, head of RT Margarita Simonyan was so furious about Russias latest defeat in Ukraine, she admitted not wanting to even come to the show. Her recipe for boosting the morale was simple: total disgrace and brutal punishment for those who dare to disappoint fellow imperialists. Seething with anger, Simonyan recited: ""Cowardice, willful abandonment of strategic positions without coordination with higher command, the collapse of command and control of the troops, inaction of power."" She qualified that these charges led to the execution of General Dmitry Pavlov, his deputies and other commanders of the Western Front during WWII. Simonyan added: ""Were terribly concerned, terribly upset, I didnt even want to come here, because to grieve and to panic would amount to helping the enemy, indirectly working towards the success of the collective CIA which for decades has worked--and continues its work--to destroy our country. What else is there to say?"" To cheer up the viewers, Simonyan reminisced about the horrific scenes that unfolded during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, pointing out: ""Our entire country was laughing out loud... Of course, it wasnt right to laugh, because people were dying, but there was so much there for us to mock them [the West]."" Simonyan revealed her pull within Russias power structure, by noting that subsequent to her public complaints about serious issues plaguing the ""partial"" mobilization, a special meeting was arranged to alleviate her concerns: ""We met up with some Generals, which was a closed meeting, of course. I will not--and have no right--to comment on that."" Assuring the audience that problems with mobilization are a thing of the past, Simonyan went on to explain the string of Russias failures in Ukraine: ""Just imagine the size of the territory and the population in question... This territory is three times larger than Belgium, where NATOs headquarters are located... Can we even imagine the magnitude of this task?"" She sternly added: ""This territory, three times the size of Belgium, is saturated with every kind of weapon, all sorts of instructors, all of the will, force and might of the entire collective West. If anyone in the Army doesnt understand that, perhaps we should revisit the first topic and replace these people."" Simonyan clarified that unlike the host, Vladimir Solovyov, she is against summary executions, but her repeated references to Stalins tactics suggested otherwise. Simonyan, who in the beginning of the invasion predicted it would be over in a matter of hours or days, now said, ""No one knows how it will end or when, but we have no way back."" She concluded her pep talk by emphasizing many Russian achievements that surpass the West, including Olympic games and ""the coolest COVID vaccine."" Simonyan alleged that when three of her children fell ill with COVID, only one person out of the twenty that live in the same house was infected: an American language teacher--the only one who wasnt vaccinated with Sputnik V. The head of RT admitted that when she sings the state anthem of the Russian Federation, which is set to the same music as the anthem of the former USSR, she uses the Soviet lyrics. Simonyan stressed: ""These words fit this moment. Comrades Generals, I ask you: dont disgrace this anthem, our faith and our desperate desire to keep these people with us, to keep these territories with us, and return to normalcy as an even bigger Russia."" Not all state TV pundits share Simonyans fervor, particularly in the aftermath of Russias frontline defeats. Last Friday, when the impending fall of Lyman was already anticipated, appearing on Russia's NTV show The Meeting Place, Russias former Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Fedorov warned that at some point in the future, Ukraine may retaliate by striking not only Russias border regions, but large cities like Moscow. During the same show, political editor Maxim Yusin bitterly noted that despite their statements on live TV, all pundits share different takes in private: ""You say, 'after the rest of the territories will be liberated. Its very difficult to argue with dreamers, who live in their own world. I see the dynamics of the military actions on the front... Ask anyone here when they're in the make-up room. I think anyone will honestly admit that they don't know whether the mobilization will help us or not to change the course of military actions. So far, things aren't going so well.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-putin-crony-admits-they-want-to-grieve-and-to-panic-over-ukraine
['David Rothkopf'],Putin's Headed Toward Defeat in Ukraine. The Only Question Is How Bad a Loser He'll Be.,2022-09-15 14:04:12,U.S. officials ponder whether the Russian despot will simply scapegoat some generals or if hell scorch the earth as he retreats.,"As Ukraines two-pronged offensive against the Russians continues, one great imponderable troubles U.S. policymakers. Can Vladimir Putin handle the truth? Speaking to one senior administration official this week, he wondered aloud whether and how Putin would respond to the massive blows being delivered against his army, especially if the Russians keep losing ground. Can Putin simply acknowledge what has happened, withdraw, and turn the page? Will he identify and possibly eliminate scapegoats--such as Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and some generals? Will he lash out and lay waste to whatever parts of Ukraine he can strike? Or will he use tactical nuclear weapons? A related series of questions also are currently being evaluated by Western analysts. And those revolve around how will the three main groups surrounding Putin respond; the people of Russia, the business elites, and the security services. In the views of one official with whom I spoke, the X-factor is whether the security services will indefinitely tolerate the damage Putins catastrophic blunder in Ukraine is doing to Russia. ""The people are likely to tolerate Putins failures and the hardships for the country. The business elites are getting restive and may put pressure on him. But how the security services go will determine whether Putin has a future as Russias leader or not,"" the official said. All of these questions have been brought to the fore due to the stunning successes Ukraine has achieved both from the outset of the current phase of the conflict in February and, more recently, with their lightning offensives that have resulted in defeat after humiliating, devastating defeat for the Russians. Russia is, quite simply, losing. And the Russians may keep losing as Ukraine moves toward strategic cities in the north, and then turns its attention south to Kherson, and ultimately to coastal regions. When asked whether the coming winter will see a significant slowdown in fighting, the official with whom I spoke questioned the whole concept that winter was an impediment to an expanded war that began, as he rightly noted, in mid-winter. When asked whether we will still be discussing the conduct of the war a year from now, he nodded, indicating that the general expectation is that, despite Ukraines victories, it will be a difficult and time-consuming prospect to dislodge Russia entirely from Ukraine. Nonetheless, there is a sense of admiration for what the Ukrainians have achieved in the current offensive, just as there is optimism about the future of their operations. They have demonstrated themselves to be superior strategists and fighters to the Russians, having relegated ""the worlds second best army"" to being the second best (if that) in their own neighborhood. Officials assured me that the U.S. and the West remain committed to supporting Ukraine, and to providing the assistance needed to capitalize on the recent wave of Ukrainian victories. Further, U.S. officials believe that while Russia will try to inflict pain on Europe in the form of reducing access to crucial energy supplies this winter, they also believe that Europe is preparing to weather that squeeze. Multiple new supplies of gas are being negotiated and new policies are being implemented, which could bring with them the long-term benefit of ensuring Europe is permanently immune to Russian energy blackmail efforts. Compounding the challenge for Russia is the recently started war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, a distraction at just the wrong time for Moscow which has pledged in the past to intervene on Armenias behalf. Further, while Russia might hope for greater support from China, its most important ally--perhaps coming in the wake of this weeks scheduled meeting between Putin and Chinese President Xi at the ""Shanghai Summit"" in Uzbekistan--that support is unlikely to come in the form of military assistance. The Russians and the Chinese have talked a good game of solidarity, but China has been wary of getting too involved in what they see as a mess of Russias making in Ukraine and, concerned with economic issues at home, the Chinese government especially does not wish to damage relations with the EU--which would certainly be the case were China to provide weapons to Russia and the West were to respond with sanctions against Beijing. All of this is to say: Putin is in a pickle. Things have gotten so bad that the significant quantities of abandoned, usable Russian vehicles, weapons, and ammunition left on the battlefield are now being described by the Ukrainians with their characteristic mordant humor as ""Russian Lend Lease."" Thats why the question turns to what Putin and those around him will do in response to defeat after defeat and the harsh reality that victory for Russia is really an impossibility at this point. U.S. officials said they have directly told the Russians that the use of tactical nuclear weapons would trigger a response that would surely and deeply compound Russias pain. That likely does not portend the use of U.S. or Western nuclear weapons. But it could mean providing Ukraine with new weapons systems, perhaps some with the capability of striking into Russia--as well as significantly enhancing aid to Ukraine and dramatically increasing sanctions on Russia. If Putin does not choose that route, then what? Is the Russian president strong enough at home (and mentally healthy enough) to acknowledge the reality on the ground, offer excuses, declare victory, and fire a few senior military officials? He has never shown such equanimity in the past. If he lashes out, then how badly will he lash out? It is fair to say that Western intelligence assets are heavily devoted to tracking this situation and trying to anticipate and blunt the consequences of whatever the wounded Russian leader does. The difference between great men and pretenders is how they handle defeat. The former recognize defeat is both an inevitable aspect of long-term leadership, and that it offers lessons which they are adaptable enough to apply. The latter group--pretenders, lesser men, and worse--deny defeats, pretend they did not happen or they blame others. All indicators point to Putin being a bad loser, who will likely make a terrible situation much worse. Hoping for the best has been a losing strategy when dealing with him--which is why, for now, Ukraine, and the West must expect and prepare for the worst. We must remain committed to enabling Ukraines surprising and inspiring armed forces to fight and punish Russia until no one, not even an isolated dictator, surrounded by toadies, can deny the reality of defeat on the ground--or until those around Putin acknowledge the inevitable, by putting a stop to his reign of brutality before all of Russia suffers even more greatly the cost of their leaders obsession, cruelty, and denial.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-headed-toward-defeat-in-ukraine-the-only-question-is-how-bad-a-loser-hell-be
['Julia Davis'],Team Putin Threatens Maniacal Response to Bitter War Losses,2022-09-15 08:47:13,"Vladimir Putins mouthpieces are threatening to unleash ""real hell"" after a slew of staggering failures in the war.","The humiliating defeats of Russias Armed Forces in Ukraine are prompting the Kremlins mouthpieces to propose increasingly violent tactics. Lobbying for a ""scorched earth"" policy on state television, Russian pundits and expert guests have been openly comparing the Ukrainian battleground to Chechnya, Syria, and even the infamous Beslan school massacre, where Russian special forces killed many hostages along with their terrorist captors. Appearing on Wednesdays broadcast of the state TV show 60 Minutes, military expert Igor Korotchenko said: ""This is a new reality, which is why we should be acting quickly, harshly and uncompromisingly. First of all, we need to scale up our strikes against critical infrastructure in such a way that one region after the next, one district after another, Ukraine is plunged into darkness... By December, 20 million residents of Ukraine should flee to the West, to the European Union. This is our goal and the task we should accomplish."" Korotchenko proposed: ""Perhaps we should openly declare: 'Leave. Zelensky is turning this territory into a real hell. No one knows what will happen here next. Twenty million, go to Europe. After that, we sink region after region into darkness. This is our enemy nation, the modern Third Reich, and we should act accordingly."" Similar proposals permeated Russian airwaves, with experts arguing that the rules of the civilized world prohibiting war crimes are merely recommendations, compliance with which is optional. On Monday, appearing on The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, Andrey Sidorov, deputy dean of world politics at the Moscow State University, explained why those international conventions are irrelevant: ""The rules of war, according to international conventions, are of an advisory nature: not to strike [certain objects], if possible. But its no longer possible."" Appearing on the show The Meeting Place on Monday, Bogdan Bezpalko, member of the Council for Interethnic Relations under the President of the Russian Federation, argued: ""As far as what needs to be done, as I previously said, we need to strike the infrastructure--which cant be separated into military and civilian. If all of Ukraine is plunged into cold and darkness, if they have no fuel, reserve armies wont help them and no one will be able to deliver equipment or ammunition... These strikes should go on for two, three, five or six months in a row, leaving not one gas station intact."" Konstantin Zatulin, deputy chairman of the committee of the State Duma for the CIS, said on 60 Minutes: ""This military operation--or this war--is entering another phase... The idea that we could achieve a victory with little blood or one massive strike is now in the past... Last week, there was a widespread message--everywhere, except for our television-- that this is no time to celebrate, while were experiencing difficulties and failures at the battlefront, while were retreating... We are pondering what they will do. We need to overcome that... because victory is our only option."" Host Olga Skabeeva cautioned: ""Dont scare our people prematurely, as I understand youre talking about the possibility of mobilization."" Even the most gung-ho propagandists admit that the Russian society would be deeply unsettled at the thought of total military mobilization, and that the countrys economy is not currently equipped for such a step. The only alternative proposed by the state TVs talking heads is inflicting utter devastation upon Ukraine. Professor Alexei Fenenko, leading research fellow at the Institute of International Security Studies, attempted to lay the blame for Russias increasing brutality upon the United States. With images of the city of Mosul in ruins playing on the screen, Fenenko claimed: ""After February 24, they waited for us to do this to key cities in Ukraine. Then they would have said, 'Yes, those guys are strong."" Without a hint of self-awareness, Skabeeva noted that the bodies of the dead were left on the streets of Mosul, to decay in plain sight. Fenenko noted that this gesture was meant as a message to other enemies. "" Either you can do this to your enemies, or else youre a nobody. "" Neither Skabeeva nor Fenenko made any mention of the horrific scenes in Ukraine that unfolded in recent months, when the retreating Russian troops left multiple corpses of Ukrainian civilians on the streets of Bucha, and scores of massacred civilians in other towns and cities. Fenenko argued that in order to be respected by the United States, Russia has to reduce much of Ukraine to rubble. He said that America respects only those who can inflict devastating damage upon their adversaries: ""Either you can do this to your enemies, or else youre a nobody. If you cant do it, youre a coward and a loser.""",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-state-media-threatens-scorched-earth-response-to-bitter-losses-in-ukraine

Source: Meduza, the Latvia-based news agency, described as a ""foreign agent"" in Russia Details: In the last few weeks, representatives of the Russian government have been increasingly talking about negotiations with Ukraine or Western countries. Meduza writes that Vladimir Putin is indeed thinking about resuming negotiations, despite Volodymyr Zelenskyy's refusal to negotiate with him after the annexation of 4 Ukrainian oblasts. However, the news agency indicates, Putin wants Russia to retain control over the territories in Donbas, and he ""does not want to discuss Crimea[n issue] at all"". According to three Meduzas sources close to the Kremlin, these positions have not changed. Quote: ""Nevertheless, according to Meduza's interlocutors, the Russian authorities have developed a new ""tactical option"". It does not involve the conclusion of a full-fledged peace treaty, but the implementation of a temporary ceasefire regime. According to the Kremlin's plan, the Russian and Ukrainian military could agree on this without the involvement of the leaders of both states. According to Meduza sources close to the Kremlin, probably for the sake of this agreement, the Russian authorities are ready to withdraw troops from at least part of the occupied territory of the Kherson Oblast"". Details: At the same time, one of Meduza's sources that was close to the Kremlin admitted: ""Now it is very difficult to hold Kherson, and the withdrawal of troops from the Oblast can be done as a gesture of goodwill and a step towards Ukraine"". Currently, the Kremlin is trying to ""influence Western leaders"" and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, so that they would ""convince"" Ukraine to get back to negotiations with Russia. Meduzas sources say that in these conversations with the leaders of other countries, Russian representatives give ""a simple argument: it is necessary to avoid casualties among the civilian population"". Story continues This sounds hypocritical against the background of the recent massive rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities, which started after the explosion at Crimean Bridge and the successful counteroffensive launched by Ukrainian forces. Details: Meduzas sources emphasised that Vladimir Putin is not going to give up the continuation of the war - and hopes to use the possible ceasefire to prepare for a new offensive. According to one of sources, during this time, the Russian army will manage to train mobilised Russians and at least somehow compensate for the losses in equipment. The press secretary of the president, Dmitry Peskov, did not answer Meduza's questions regarding this. The Kremlin's plan foresaw, Meduzas sources explained, that ""a new full-scale offensive"" could begin around February-March 2023. Details: At the same time, Kyiv's position regarding negotiations with Moscow remains unchanged. ""We will be ready for negotiations with Russia, not with Putin, but with whoever will replace him,"" the interlocutor in the Office of the President of Ukraine repeated Volodymyr Zelenskyy and suggested to the Russians: ""Topple your unreasonable Putin"". The source emphasised that Ukraine has long distrusted Russia's statements and ""goodwill gestures"". According to it, ""there will be no ceasefire"" until Ukrainian territories are liberated. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of Office of President of Ukraine, said that the Russian scenario is ""absolutely definitely not in favour of Ukraine"" and that only a military defeat of the Russian Federation will allow a real end to the war. Podolyaks quote: ""What does a cease-fire give to Ukraine under the Russian scenario? Fixation of a de facto new line of demarcation and hasty entrenchment of the Russians in the temporarily occupied territories? Can we seriously assume that we will agree to this? Especially against the background of a counteroffensive... A clear operational pause for the badly damaged detachments of the Russians, in order to train at least some of the mobilised and hastily send a new number of suicide bombers to the battlefield? Why do we need this?"". Background: Russia annexed Crimea and started an armed conflict in Donbas in 2014, and on 24 February 2022, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and seized another part of its territory. On 30 September, when Vladimir Putin completed the farce regarding Russia's annexation of four regions of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine stated that it was impossible to negotiate with Putin. Later, Zelenskyy announced that it was difficult to negotiate with ""unreasonable people"", among whom he referred to Putin. Kharkiv Oblast was almost completely liberated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in September, and the counteroffensive in the Kherson Oblast is progressing in October. Western military officials assume that the defenders of Ukraine can liberate Kherson from the Russian invaders in the second decade of October, the Financial Times wrote.

Putin -- facing domestic discontent and military setbacks in a neighboring country armed with increasingly advanced Western weapons -- also told reporters he does not regret starting the conflict and ""did not set out to destroy Ukraine"" when he ordered Russian troops to invade nearly eight months ago. ""What is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly,"" he said after attending a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kazakhstan's capital. ""But we would have had all this a little later, only under worse conditions for us, thats all. So my actions are correct and timely."" Russia's difficulties in achieving its war aims have become apparent in one of the four Ukrainian regions Putin illegally claimed as Russian territory last month. Anticipating an advance by Ukrainian forces, Moscow-installed authorities in the Kherson region urged residents to flee Friday. Even some of Putins own supporters have criticized the Kremlins handling of the war and mobilization, increasing pressure on him to do more to turn the tide in Russias favor. In his comments on the army mobilization, Putin said the action he ordered last month had registered 222,000 of the 300,000 reservists the Russian Defense Ministry set as an initial goal. A total of 33,000 of them have joined military units, and 16,000 are deployed for combat, he said. Putin ordered the call-up to bolster the fight along a 1,100-km (684-mile) front line where Ukrainian counteroffensives have inflicted blows to Moscows military prestige. The mobilization was troubled from the start, with confusion about who was eligible for the draft in a country where almost all men under age 65 are registered as reservists. Story continues Opposition to the order was so strong that tens of thousands of men left Russia, and others protested in the streets. Critics were skeptical the draft would end in two weeks. They predicted only a pause to allow enlistment offices to process regular conscripts during Russias annual fall draft for men aged 18-27, which was postponed from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. ""Do not believe Putin about 'two weeks. Mobilization can only be canceled by his decree. No decree - no cancellation,"" Vyacheslav Gimadi, an attorney for imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalnys Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote on Facebook. Asked about the possibility of an expanded mobilization, the Russian president said the Defense Ministry had not asked him to authorize one. ""Nothing further is planned,"" Putin said, adding, ""In the foreseeable future, I dont see any need."" Putin and other officials stated in September the mobilization would affect some 300,000 people, but his enabling decree did not cite a specific number. Russian media reports have suggested it could be as high as 1.2 million. Putin had also said only those with combat or service experience would be drafted. He later admitted military officials had made mistakes, such as enlisting reservists without the relevant background. Men who received minimal training decades ago were drafted in droves. Reports also have surfaced that some recruits were sent to the front lines in Ukraine with little preparation and inadequate equipment. Several mobilized reservists were reported to have died in combat in Ukraine this week, just days after they were drafted. Putin responded to the criticism Friday, saying all activated recruits should receive adequate training and that he would assign Russias Security Council ""to conduct an inspection of how mobilized citizens are being trained."" Before launching the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin questioned Ukraines right to exist as a sovereign nation, portraying the country as part of historic Russia. Asked about this on Friday, he repeated his claim that Russia was prepared for peace talks and again accused the Ukrainian government of quitting negotiations after Russian troops withdrew from Kyiv early in the war. Ukraine rejected any possibility of negotiating with Putin after he illegally annexed Ukraines Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions last month based on ""referendums"" that Kyiv and the West denounced as a sham. The battlefield momentum has shifted toward Ukraine as its military recaptures cities, towns and villages that Russia took early in the war. After occupied Kherson's worried Kremlin-backed leaders asked civilians to evacuate to ensure their safety and to give Russian troops more maneuverability, Moscow offered free accommodations. Russia has characterized the movement of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-controlled territory as voluntary, but in many cases they aren't allowed to travel to Ukrainian-held territory, and reports have surfaced that some were forcibly deported to ""filtration camps"" with harsh conditions. An Associated Press investigation found that Russian officials deported thousands of Ukrainian children - some orphaned, others living with foster families or in institutions - to be raised as Russian. Ukrainian forces reported retaking 75 populated places in northern Kherson in the last month, according to Ukraines Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. A similar campaign in eastern Ukraine resulted in most of the Kharkiv region returning to Ukrainian control, as well as parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the ministry said. As they retreat, Russian forces are adding to their losses by abandoning weapons and ammunition. In the U.S., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence presented a slide deck Friday stating that at least 6,000 pieces of Russian equipment have been lost since the start of the war. The presentation outlines enormous pressure on Russias defense industry to replace its losses and says that because of export controls and international sanctions, Russia is expending munitions at an unsustainable rate. Konstantin, a Kherson resident who spoke to the AP only if his last name was withheld for safety reasons, said columns of military trucks had moved around the region's capital and eventually left. Most government offices have reduced working hours, and schools have closed, he said. ""The city is now in suspense. Primarily the Russian military from the headquarters and the family of collaborators are leaving,"" Konstantin said. ""Everyone is discussing the imminent arrival of the Ukrainian military and preparing for it."" Russian forces on Friday carried out missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city, and in the Zaphorizhzhia region, home to Europe's biggest nuclear power plant. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog has warned that fighting at or near the Russian-controlled Zaphorizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, now shuttered, could trigger a catastrophic radiation release. Putin has vowed to retaliate if Ukraine or its allies strike Russian territory, including the annexed regions of Ukraine. Russias Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine came under attack for a second day Friday. According to Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the shelling damaged an electric substation, five houses in the village of Voznesenovka and a power line, leaving several nearby villages temporarily without electricity. No casualties or injuries were reported. Ukrainian shelling blew up an ammunition depot in the Belgorod region on Thursday, according to Russias Investigative Committee. Unconfirmed media reports said three Russian National Guard officers were killed and more than 10 were wounded. Vowing to liberate all Russian-occupied areas, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraines armed forces, said in a video message Friday, ""We have buried the myth of the invincibility of the Russian army."" ---- Yuras Karmanau contributed reporting from Tallinn, Estonia. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-evacuate-kherson-residents-ukraine-060501878.html

Russia and Ukraine agreed in early August to a U.N. fact-finding mission on the July explosion, but U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Friday: ""We still need to have the appropriate security guarantees in place for them to be able to go about their work."" ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS: -- Putin: Call-up of Russian reservists to finish soon -- Turkey, Russia to act on Putins gas hub offer -- Russia to evacuate Kherson residents as Ukraine advances -- Russian man stopped with drones in Norway -- Whats the state of Russias missile arsenal? -- How Moscow grabs Ukrainian kids and makes them Russians -- Orphan watched dad die, awaits future in Ukraine shelter -- Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Story continues ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: MOSCOW -- Russian officials say Ukrainian forces have shelled the Belgorod region of Russia, which lies across the border from Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov and other Russian officials said Friday the shelling blew up an ammunition depot, hit a multi-story residential building and knocked out power to a handful of villages. No casualties or injuries were reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to retaliate harshly if Ukraine or its allies strike Russian territory, including the annexed regions of Ukraine. ___ Russian President Vladimir Putin reckons a mobilization of army reservists he ordered last month to bolster his countrys deployment in Ukraine will to be completed in two weeks. Putin told reporters after attending a summit in Kazakhstan on Friday that 222,000 reservists have been mobilized. The Russian Defense Ministry had said it was aiming for a total of around 300,000 reservists. A total of 33,000 of them are already in military units, and 16,000 are involved in the military operation in Ukraine. The call-up, announced by Putin in September, has proved hugely unpopular in Russia, where almost all men under the age of 65 are registered as reservists. The Russian leader initially described the mobilization as ""partial"" and said only those with combat or service experience would be drafted. However, a decree he signed outlined almost no specific criteria. Russian media reports have described attempts to round up men without the relevant experience, including those ineligible for service for medical reasons. In the wake of the presidents mobilization order, tens of thousands of men left Russia. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania -- A heavily armed U.S. battalion is set to remain in Lithuania until at least 2026, amid fears about Russias intentions in the region following its invasion of Ukraine. The Baltic NATO members defense minister announced the decision Friday after a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Bucharest. ""The decision to extend the presence of the rotational battalion in Lithuania shows that the U.S. takes Baltic security seriously,"" Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said. ""It also sends a message to Russia. The Americans are here, and they are not going anywhere."" The U.S. Army deployed a contingent of some 500 soldiers to Lithuania on a troop rotation basis in 2019. The forces include the U.S. Armored Brigade Combat Teams that have been on exercises in the eastern flank countries since 2017. Additional U.S. forces arrived in Lithuania, a month after Russias attack on Ukraine, and the rotation of the U.S. 3-66 Armor battalions rotation has been extended. ___ Kremlin-backed authorities in the eastern Luhansk region of Ukraine, illegally annexed by Moscow last month, say 10 captured servicemen have returned to the area in a prisoner exchange with Ukraine. They are currently undergoing rehabilitation, Russian-backed human rights official Victoria Serdyukova told Russian state news agency Tass on Friday. The announcement follows a prisoner exchange on Thursday, in which 20 Ukrainian soldiers and 20 Russian soldiers were swapped. The last large-scale exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine, involving nearly 300 people, took place at the end of September. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces have launched at least four missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraines second largest city. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported the explosions on Friday afternoon. He offered no details on the extent of the damage or possible casualties. The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, urged local residents to heed air raid sirens and take cover in bomb shelters. On Thursday evening, two Russian strikes left Kharkiv, where the pre-war population stood at 1.4 million, without electricity. The Ukrainian army has retaken most of the previously occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, but the Russians continue to shell the regions capital with missiles. ___ The Russian government says that the restoration of a Crimean bridge damaged in a recent explosion is scheduled for completion by July next year. A decree published on a government website Friday also identified the company hired to carry out the work on the bridge that links Russia to the annexed Crimea. The Kerch Bridge, which holds important strategic and symbolic value to Russia in its faltering war in Ukraine, was hit Oct. 8 by what Moscow says was a truck bomb. Road and rail traffic on the bridge were temporarily halted, undermining a vital supply route for the Kremlins forces. Also Friday, a court in Simferopol, the second-largest city in Crimea, formally arrested and placed five suspects in pre-trial detention in relation to the explosion, according to an Interfax report. Russias Federal Security Service (FSB) previously said it had identified 12 suspects involved in the explosion. The FSB alleged the involvement of Ukrainian, Armenian and Russian citizens in what it described as a ""terrorist act."" ___ GENEVA -- The International Committee of the Red Cross says it shares ""frustration"" about incomplete access to prisoners amid Russias war in Ukraine. However, the humanitarian organization notes that there are limits on what it can do. ICRC spokesman Ewan Watson said Friday that ""we have been able to visit hundreds of POWs on both sides, but there are thousands more who we have not been able to see."" He noted that the third Geneva Convention obliges parties to international armed conflicts to grant the ICRC immediate access to all POWs, wherever they are held. On Thursday, the head of the Ukrainian presidents office, Andriy Yermak, said Kyiv was giving the ICRC three days to send a mission to the Olenivka penal colony, located in a Russian-run part of the Donetsk region, where many Ukrainian POWs are held. Olenivka was the scene of a deadly explosion in July, for which Russia and Ukraine blamed each other. Watson said that ""our teams are ready on the ground and have been ready for months to visit the Olenivka penal facility and any other facility where POWs are held."" But he added that ""beyond being granted access by high levels of authority, this requires practical arrangements to materialize on the ground. We cannot access by force a place of detention or internment where we have not been admitted."" Watson said that the call for full and regular access to prisoners of war goes to both sides. ___ Russian-installed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine are repeating calls for local residents to evacuate to Russia, citing incessant shelling by advancing Ukrainian forces. The deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, urged people Friday to take ""humanitarian trips"" to Russia ""in order to avoid civilian casualties"" in the war. The Kremlin-backed administration of Kherson on Thursday announced plans to evacuate civilians, with Russian authorities promising to provide free accommodation for them. The move came as Ukrainian forces push their counteroffensive deeper into the southern Kherson region, albeit at a slower pace. Russia illegally annexed Kherson, as well as the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region and Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, last month, following ""referendums"" in all four regions that Kyiv and the West denounced as a sham. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraines presidential office says Friday that over the previous 24 hours at least nine civilians were killed and 15 injured. Friday is Defenders Day in Ukraine, which traditionally is a public holiday, but celebrations are muted because of the war against Russia's invasion. In Kyiv, a concert at the central opera house was cancelled because of planned, rotating power outages across the city as energy infrastructure damaged by bombing is repaired. In the Kherson region, which is a key link to Crimea, the Ukrainian army continued to slowly advance along the right bank of the Dnieper. Ukraines armed forces commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhny vowed to forge ahead with a counteroffensive launched last month. ""Were getting (what is) ours back. No one and nothing will stop us,"" Zaluzhny said in a video message. ""We have buried the myth of the invincibility of the Russian army."" ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia is keeping up its targeted attacks on critical infrastructure across Ukraine, in a fifth straight day of intensified bombardments. Multiple Russian missile strikes shook the capital of the Zaphorizhzhia region overnight as the city continued to be a focal point for Russian fire. Zaporizhzhia regional Governor Oleksandr Starukh said Friday morning several explosions were reported in the city overnight at infrastructure facilities, causing fires. Preliminary reports mentioned no victims. Russian forces have struck the regional capital and the surrounding area continuously in recent days and weeks, creating concerns about the safety of the nearby nuclear power plant. The regional capital is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the plant, which is the largest nuclear power facility in Europe. The heavier Russian barrage began last Monday and comes as Ukraine pushes its military counteroffensive on the southern front. ___ Russia is promising free accommodation to residents of the partially occupied Kherson region who want to evacuate to Russia. The move suggests that Ukrainian military gains along the southern front are worrying the Kremlin. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made the announcement shortly after the Russia-backed leader of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, asked the Kremlin to organize an evacuation from four cities of the region. Saldo said in a video posted online Thursday that Ukraines missile strikes are causing ""serious damage,"" claiming they had struck hotels, residential buildings and markets. Kherson is one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Moscow last month. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian armed forces are reporting steady territorial gains along the southern front in the countrys battle against invading Russian forces, including the recapture of 75 settlements in the Kherson region in the last month. The Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories announced late Thursday that Ukraines armed forces have recaptured 502 settlements in the Kharkiv region, 43 in the Donetsk region and seven in the Luhansk region. Russian officials say Ukrainian shelling on Thursday evening blew up an ammunition depot in Russias Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine. Russias Investigative Committee said Friday that an unspecified number of people were killed and wounded in the incident. Unconfirmed media reports said three officers of Russias National Guard were killed and more than 10 were wounded.",https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-russia-ukraine-war-085114501.html

What is Elon Musk up to in Ukraine? 19:01 , Holly Bancroft Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla and SpaceX and the richest man in the world, has unexpectedly indicated that the latter company will no longer be providing its Starlink satellite internet service to Ukrainians for free. The service has proven invaluable in the country since Russias invasion began on 24 February, enabling the Ukrainian military to keep lines of communication open even when IT infrastructure has been destroyed by enemy missiles. The company first dispatched its terminals to the warzone just days into the conflict after Ukraines vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted Mr Musk directly asking for his help, returning to social media just two days later with a picture posted in gratitude to show the first shipment of Starlink equipment arriving.

Newly appointed central bank governor Andriy Pyshnyi said on Facebook that he would make the request on behalf of the bank in a letter to the FATF before the organisations plenary session between 18 to 21 October. Russia is currently a member of FATF. Ukraine is not a member. Mr Pyshnyi accused Russia of ""creating serious threats to the security and integrity of the worlds financial system"" and demanded that Moscow be made to ""feel the price"" for its invasion of Ukraine.

He said a total of 222,000 reservists would be called-up, down from the 300,000 figure initially quoted by the defence ministry when the order was announced last month. Eleanor Sly reports: Putin warns of 'global catastrophe if Nato troops clash with Russian forces Ukraine war to slash European gas consumption 'almost 50 per cent by 2050 16:40 , Eleanor Sly Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine is slashing European countries gas use but will ultimately speed the transition to renewables, a new report claims. Projections of European gas use by the middle of the century have tumbled from 310 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year predicted one year ago, to 170 bcm now. This represents a fall in demand by 2050 of 45.2 per cent, according to the report by Norwegian consultancy group DNV. Harry Cockburn reports: Ukraine war to slash European gas consumption 'almost 50 per cent by 2050 US will impose sanctions on those supporting Russia 16:15 , Eleanor Sly The United States on Friday warned it can impose sanctions on anyone - people, countries and companies - that provide ammunition to Moscow or support its military-industrial complex, as Washington seeks to increase pressure on Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo, at a gathering of officials from 32 countries to discuss sanctions on Russia, said the department will issue guidance on Friday and made it clear that Washington is willing and able to impose such a crackdown.

'We do not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine, says Putin 14:45 , Eleanor Sly Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday there was no need for massive new strikes on Ukraine and that Russia was not aiming to destroy its neighbour. Speaking to a news conference at the end of a summit in Kazakhstan, Mr Putin said that his call-up of Russian reservists would be over within two weeks, adding he had no plans for a further mobilisation. He also said again that the Kremlin position that Russia was willing to hold talks, although he said that they would require international mediation if Ukraine was willing to take part. Taken together, Mr Putins comments appeared to suggest a slight softening of his tone as the war nears the end of its eighth month, after weeks of Ukrainian advances and significant Russian defeats. But he was speaking just a week when Russia has staged its heaviest missile attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities since the start of its invasion in February - an action that Mr Putin has said was retaliation for an attack that damaged a Russian bridge to occupied Crimea. ""We do not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. No, of course not,"" Mr Putin said. He said there was ""no need for massive strikes"" now, due to the fact that most designated targets had been hit. Russian army using rape as a 'deliberate strategy in Ukraine, claims UN envoy 14:30 , Eleanor Sly Rape and sexual assaults have been used as a deliberate part of Russian ""military strategy"" in Ukraine, according to a UN envoy.

Elon Musk suggests he is pulling internet service from Ukraine because ambassador was rude to him 08:39 , Eleanor Sly Elon Musks Starlink satellite internet will no longer be provided to Ukrainians for free, and has apparently asked the Pentagon to pay for it. The news comes days after Ukrainian ambassador Andrij Melnyk shot back at the multibillionaires proposal that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could be ended by, among other things, formally allowing Russia to annex Crimea. Mr Musk has said he is ""just following [the] recommendation"" of the Ukrainian ambassador.

Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin made the announcement after the Russia-backed leader of Kherson - one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Moscow last month - asked the Moscow to organise an evacuation from four cities in the region. In a video posted online, Vladimir Saldo said: ""Cities of the Kherson region - Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, Hola Prystan and Chornobaivka - are subject to daily missile strikes. ""These missile strikes cause serious damage, first and foremost to the residents. Among targets missiles hit are hotels, residential buildings, markets - [places] where there are lots of civilians."" Mr Saldo said a decision has been made to evacuate Kherson residents to the Russian regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol. They will also be evacuated to the annexed region of Crimea. ""I would like to ask you to help organise this process,"" he said. ""We, residents of the Kherson region, of course know that Russia doesnt abandon their own, and Russia always offers a hand.""

According to Vyacheslav Gladkov, on the Telegram messaging app, anti-craft defences shot down missiles near Novyi Oskol, a town of about 18,000 people which lies about 90 kilometres (56 miles) to the north of the border with Ukraine. ""Power lines are damaged. Trains are temporarily suspended,"" Mr Gladkov said, before adding that there were no casualties. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. There also apparently no immediate reaction from Kyiv. Can Putin survive - or will he be overthrown? 07:03 , Arpan Rai What appears to be a string of recent setbacks for Russia in Ukraine has fuelled speculation about whether Vladimir Putin can survive as countrys leader. And even if he can, for how long. Not all autocrats lose power after a failed military campaign - Saddam Hussein survived even after Iraqs disastrous war with Iran - but sooner or later many do, as their authority is so entwined with their nations battlefield prowess. But, the fiercest public criticism of the war in Russia is coming not from the liberal left, but from the nationalist right, writes Mary Dejevsky in Voices. Read it here: Can Putin survive - or will he be overthrown? | Mary Dejevsky Russias Wagner troops slowly making progress in Donbas amid severe manpower shortages - MoD 06:59 , Arpan Rai The British defence ministry has claimed tactical advances by pro-Russian forces towards the centre of the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk oblast in the last three days. ""Elements of 2nd Army Corps, the pro-Russia militia of the Luhansk region, likely advanced into the villages of Opytine and Ivangrad to the south of the town,"" the ministry said in its latest intelligence update on the Ukraine war. It added that there are few, if any, other settlements seized by regular Russian or separatist forces since early July. ""However, forces led by the private military company Wagner Group have achieved some localised gains in the Donbas: Wagner likely remains heavily involved in the Bakhmut fighting,"" the British MoD said. According to the defence ministry, Russia likely looks at seizing Bakhmut as a ""preliminary to advancing on the Kramatorsk-Sloviansk urban area which is the most significant population centre of Donetsk oblast held by Ukraine."" Russia continues to prosecute offensive operations in central Donbas and is, very slowly, making progress, the ministry added. ""However, its overall operational design is undermined by the Ukrainian pressure against its northern and southern flanks, and by severe shortages of munitions and manpower,"" it said.

Russia expects mobilised men as 'cannon fodder to last a few weeks in Ukraine war - Zelensky 05:31 , Arpan Rai Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Russia is dispatching mobilised men to the wars frontlines and expects them to be a cannon fodder surviving the war for at least few weeks. ""Now Russia is sending thousands of its mobilised men to the front. They have no significant military training, but their command does not need it at all,"" Mr Zelensky said in his nightly address. He added: ""They expect that the mobilised Russians will be able to survive in the war for at least a few weeks, then they will die, and then new ones will be sent to the front."" ""But during this time, such use by Russian generals of their people as ""cannon fodder"" makes it possible to create additional pressure on our defenders,"" the war-time president said. Elon Musks SpaceX says can no longer pay for Starlink satellite services in Ukraine 05:02 , Arpan Rai Elon Musks SpaceX has told the Pentagon it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink satellite internet terminals, asking that the service providing a vital source of communication for Ukraines military will now have to be paid for by the US, CNN has learnt. The spacecraft engineering firm has donated around 20,000 Starlink satellite units to Ukraine as the besieged country lost cellular phone and internet networks in the Russian invasion since February. According to a report by CNN, SpaceXs director of government has told the Pentagon in a letter in September that they ""are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time."" Additionally, SpaceX owner and billionaire Elon Musk has said that the operation has cost it ""$80m & will exceed $100m by end of year."" SpaceX claims that the transfer of its charitable services to the war-hit country would cost the US more than $120m for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400m for the next 12 months. Russia tells civilians to evacuate annexed Kherson as Ukrainian forces advance 04:57 , Arpan Rai Russia has told residents of illegally annexed Kherson to evacuate as Ukrainian troops approach, raising fears the region could become the new frontline in Vladimir Putins war. Moscow-installed governor Vladimir Saldo told Khersons civilians to take their children and flee in a video statement on Telegram on Thursday. ""Every day, the cities of Kherson region are subjected to missile attacks,"" Mr Saldo said. ""As such, the leadership of Kherson administration has decided to provide Kherson families with the option to travel to other regions of the Russian Federation to rest and study."" Read the full story here: Russia tells civilians to evacuate annexed Kherson as Ukrainian forces advance Ukraine recaptured more than 600 settlements from Russia last month - officials 04:29 , Arpan Rai Ukraine has retaken more than 600 settlements from Russian forces in the past month, its ministry for reintegration of the temporary occupied territories said. These also include 75 settlements from the recently annexed Kherson region which serves as a highly strategic region in the south of the besieged country and claimed by Russia. Around 502 settlements have been freed and retaken by Ukrainian soldiers in Kharkiv which lies in the northeast Ukraine and was heavily battered in the Russian invasion. However, Ukrainian troops advanced deeper into the Russian lines last month. A total of 43 settlements have been recaptured in the Donetsk region and seven in the Luhansk region, the ministry said. ""The area of liberated Ukrainian territories has increased significantly,"" the ministry said in a statement. Russia warns of World War Three over Ukraine Nato bid as alliance says it will not be intimidated 04:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Russia has warned Ukraine that joining Nato could trigger a third world war as alliance members consider Kyivs application. A senior Russian official claimed Ukraine knew the severe consequences of joining, as he reiterated his countrys opposition to Ukraine becoming part of the military alliance. ""Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three,"" Alexander Venediktov, deputy secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, is reported as saying by the Tass news agency. ""Apparently, thats what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again."" Russia warns of World War Three over Ukraine Nato membership bid Putins Ukraine war is 'a crusade against democracy, warns Germanys Scholz 03:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has claimed that Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine is a ""crusade against democracy"". Mr Scholz also pledged to keep supporting Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" while speaking at a summit in Berlin. ""Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy,"" said Scholz. He added that Germany will ""continue our support for as long as it takes, for as long as that support is needed to fend off Russias abhorrent aggression"". It followed up an attack last month by Scholz on Russia, when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. Putins Ukraine war is 'a crusade against democracy, warns Germanys Scholz Kremlin says its goals in Ukraine can be achieved through talks 02:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Thursday that the goals of Moscows ""special military operation"" in Ukraine were unchanged, but that they could be achieved through negotiations. The comments to the Russian newspaper Izvestia were the latest in a series of statements this week stressing Moscows openness to talks - a change of tone that follows a run of humiliating defeats for Russian forces as the war in Ukraine nears the end of its eighth month. ""The direction has not changed, the special military operation continues, it continues in order for us to achieve our goals,"" Peskov was quoted as saying. ""However, we have repeatedly reiterated that we remain open to negotiations to achieve our objectives."" Peskov added, however, that he did not see any prospects for talks with the West in the near future because of its ""hostile"" attitude towards Russia. ""It takes two sides to have a dialogue. As the West is now taking a very, very hostile stance towards us, its unlikely that there will be any such prospect in the near future,"" - Peskov told Kazakhstans Khabar 24 TV channel, according to the Russian news agency TASS. ""Nevertheless, Turkey, as well as a number of other countries, continue to try to mediate in some way."" While Russia has said before that it is prepared to negotiate, the repeated references this week to the possibility of dialogue are striking. Russian border region says Ukraine shelled it, Kyiv blames stray Russian fire 01:00 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain The governor of a Russian border region accused Ukraine of shelling an apartment block there on Thursday but a Kyiv official said a stray Russian missile was to blame, in only one of a series of apparent strikes on Russian border towns. Vyacheslav Gladkov said a school had been damaged in a village close to the border, and that the top floor of an apartment block had been struck in the city of Belgorod. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter that Russia had launched a missile towards the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv but ""something went wrong and it hit (a) residential building"". Video showed rubble next to a 16-storey apartment block with a large rupture near its roof. Reuters could not independently establish who was to blame. Gladkov said no one had been hurt. Separately, Gladkov said that a border post in the frontier town of Shebekino, which adjoins Ukraine's eastern region of Kharkiv, and an ammunition depot near Belgorod city had been destroyed in Ukrainian strikes. He said that there had been no casualties in either strike. Video, apparently of the ammunition depot, shared on social media showed a major fire illuminating the night sky. CEO says Gazprom may need to replace big part of Nord Stream -TASS Thursday 13 October 2022 23:45 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told Russia's State TV Channel One on Thursday that a big section of the damaged Nord Stream pipelines might need to be replaced, TASS news agency said. A section of the pipeline was now filled with water across a significant distance, TASS paraphrased Miller as saying, in a series of bullet points on the agencys Telegram channel. Separately, Prime news agency paraphrased Miller as saying the affected length covered hundreds of kilometres on the Russian side of the pipeline. On Wednesday, Miller, head of the Russian state-controlled natural gas monopoly, said repairs to the damaged Nord Stream pipelines would take at least a year. IAEA's Grossi: Need quick solution on Ukraine nuclear plant Thursday 13 October 2022 23:10 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Talks on demilitarising Europes largest nuclear plant in Ukraine need a rapid solution to eliminate a ""precarious"" situation amid continued shelling, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was speaking after a day of talks with Ukrainian officials. He also said he had told Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin that the continued detention of the deputy director of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was unacceptable. ""We need to continue working to protect the plant. As I told (Putin), it continues to be extremely fragile, extremely precarious,"" Grossi told a news conference after the day of talks in Kyiv. ""I am trying to have this wrapped up as soon as possible ... it is of course counter-intuitive to talk about protecting something that is being shelled,"" Grossi said. ""...there are days when it seems to be more calm, but then the next day we are again on a blackout and the external power lines are completely cut and we dont know whether it is going to be an emergency... So these things continue. It hasnt improved in any tangible way."" Ukraine gets more air defence pledges as Russia hits cities Thursday 13 October 2022 22:01 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Ukraine's allies vowed Thursday to supply the besieged nation with advanced air defence systems as Russian forces attacked the Kyiv region with kamikaze drones and fired missiles elsewhere at civilian targets, payback for the bombing of a strategic bridge linking Russia with annexed Crimea. Missile strikes killed at least five people and destroyed an apartment building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, while heavy artillery damaged more than 30 houses, a hospital, a kindergarten and other buildings in the town of Nikopol, across the river from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Russia has intensified its bombardment of civilian areas in recent weeks as its military lost ground in multiple occupied regions of Ukraine that Russian president Vladimir Putin has illegally annexed. Kremlin war hawks have urged Putin to escalate the bombing campaign even more to punish Ukraine for Saturdays truck bomb attack on the landmark Kerch Bridge. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.""We need to protect our sky from the terror of Russia,"" Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelensky told the Council of Europe, a human rights organisation. ""If this is done, it will be a fundamental step to end the entire war in the near future."" Residents advised to flee occupied area as Ukrainian army attacks Thursday 13 October 2022 19:50 , Jane Dalton The Russian-installed governor of the southern Kherson region has told residents to take their children and flee, in one of the starkest signs yet that Moscow is losing its grip on territory it claims to have annexed. In a video statement on Telegram, Vladimir Saldo publicly asked for Moscows help transporting civilians to safer regions of Russia. ""Every day, the cities of Kherson region are subjected to missile attacks,"" Saldo said. ""As such, the leadership of Kherson administration has decided to provide Kherson families with the option to travel to other regions of the Russian Federation to rest and study. ""We suggested that all residents of the Kherson region, if they wish, to protect themselves from the consequences of missile strikes... go to other regions,"" he said, advising people to ""leave with their children"". Kherson is one of four partially occupied Ukrainian provinces that Russia claims to have annexed this month, and arguably the most strategically important. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014. War is crusade against democracy, says Scholz Thursday 13 October 2022 19:42 , Jane Dalton German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has claimed that Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine is a ""crusade against democracy"" and pledged to keep supporting Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"". David Harding reports: Putins Ukraine war is 'a crusade against democracy, warns Germanys Scholz Nato will watch Russian nuclear exercise closely Thursday 13 October 2022 19:15 , Jane Dalton Nato will monitor an expected forthcoming Russian nuclear exercise very closely, the alliances chief has said, in particular in the light of Moscows latest nuclear threats. ""We have monitored Russian nuclear forces for decades and of course we will continue to monitor them very closely and we will stay vigilant - also when they now start a new exercise,"" secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters. ""What I can say is that this exercise, the Russian exercise, is an annual exercise. Its an exercise where they test and exercise their nuclear forces,"" he added, apparently referring to Russias annual Grom exercise that normally takes place in late October and in which Russia tests its nuclear-capable bombers, submarines and missiles. ""We will monitor that as we always do. And of course we will remain vigilant, not least in light of the veiled nuclear threats and the dangerous rhetoric we have seen from the Russian side,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. What weapons has the UK sent to Ukraine? Thursday 13 October 2022 18:38 , Jane Dalton Liz Truss has vowed to keep up British support for Ukraine, telling the UN General Assembly that 2022s PS2.3bn spending would be matched again or even exceeded next year despite the countrys current economic woes. Key equipment dispatched from Britain to the frontline so far has included 6,900 anti-tank missiles, air defence systems, armoured fighting vehicles and anti-structure munitions, according to the Ministry of Defence. Joe Sommerlad reports: What weapons has the UK sent to Ukraine? Analysis: Can Putin survive? Thursday 13 October 2022 18:06 , Jane Dalton Increasingly forthright criticism of Russias war is coming from the Russian right - people who supported Putins decision to go to war, but who are now losing faith in how it is being fought. And there are reports of dissent in the Russian ranks and claims that Russia is running out of crucial equipment and munitions. But even if the prospects for Russias defeat and Ukraines victory have been exaggerated, this still does not mean that Putin is safe in his Kremlin, writes Mary Dejevsky: Can Putin survive - or will he be overthrown? | Mary Dejevsky Unrepentant Merkel defends her decision to rely on Russian gas Thursday 13 October 2022 17:45 , Jane Dalton Former German chancellor Angela Merkel has claimed she has ""no regrets"" about the energy policy her government took despite its reliance on Russia. ""You always act in the time in which you find yourself,"" she said. Emily Atkinson reports: No regrets: Unrepentant Angela Merkel defends her decision to rely on Russian gas Russian border regions say Ukraine shelled buildings Thursday 13 October 2022 17:04 , Jane Dalton Authorities in two Russian regions near the Ukrainian border say they have been shelled by Ukraine, damaging buildings and disrupting electricity supplies. The governor of Belgorod region said a school had been damaged in a village close to the border and that an apartment had been struck in Belgorod city. Video seen by Reuters showed rubble next to what appeared to be an apartment building with a large rupture near its roof. An electricity substation in the Kursk region was damaged by a shell, knocking out power to two settlements, the regions governor said. Prosecutions start over Russian missile strikes Thursday 13 October 2022 16:40 , Jane Dalton Ukraines top prosecutor says his office has opened criminal proceedings relating to Russian missile strikes that struck Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine this week. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin described the strikes since Monday as ""a classic act of terror"" by Russia. Speaking alongside International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan in The Hague, he said the more than 112 Russian missile strikes, Moscows biggest aerial offensive, had killed 17 people and injured 93. ""The goal of Russias deliberate attacks is to cause civilian deaths and to destroy civilian infrastructure, (and) by shortage of electricity and heating, provoke a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Mr Kostin said. ""Coupled with the intimidation tactics against civilians, its a classical act of terror prohibited under international law."" Every death and injury or damaged building will be documented and criminal proceedings opened, he said. Russia denies violating international law and has dismissed allegations that Russian soldiers have carried out war crimes. In the recently liberated Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine prosecutors have found at least 11 burial sites, including one mass grave near the town of Izium, and have exhumed 457 bodies across the sites, Mr Kostin said. An additional two mass graves were found in the Lyman region with some 154 people, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, buried there, he added. The prosecutors office has 28 investigative teams on the ground in the recently liberated regions, where Mr Kostin said retreating Russian troops had left evidence of illegal detention and torture of civilians and illegal deportations. Angela Merkel says she has 'no regrets on energy policy with Russia Thursday 13 October 2022 16:05 , Emily Atkinson Angela Merkel has ""no regrets"" about the course her government took with its energy policy and relations with Russia while she was Germanys chancellor. Ms Merkels comments come as Germany and other European countries are trying to end their reliance on Russian oil and gas after Putin sent troops into Ukraine as part of what he calls a special military operation. Last year, 55 per centof German gas imports came from Russia, partly the result of Merkels pursual of trade ties with Russia and backing the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, even after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. ""You always act in the time in which you find yourself,"" she told reporters in Lisbon when asked about her governments approach to Russia. Nato warns Russia nuclear threats wont intimidate it Thursday 13 October 2022 15:50 , Emily Atkinson Western allies will not been intimidated by president Vladimir Putins nuclear threats, the Nato secretary-general has declared. Speaking at the meeting of Nato ministers of defence in Brussels, Jens Stoltenberg described the Russian leaders ""nuclear rhetoric"" as ""dangerous and irresponsible"", and warned of ""severe consequences"" should Russia attempt to unleash such an attack. ""Putin knows a nuclear war cannot be fought,"" he told reporters. Mr Stoltenberg also touched on the new military support the alliance would be sending to Ukraine, including four Spanish Hawk launchers and counter-drone equipment. He also urged Nato allies to continue to ""stand up"" for Kyiv. Russias goals in Ukraine 'unchanged, but could be achieved through negotiation, says Kremlin Thursday 13 October 2022 15:20 , Emily Atkinson The Kremlin has been quoted as saying that the goals of its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine are unchanged, but that they may be achieved through negotiations.

""However we have repeatedly reiterated that we remain open to negotiations to achieve our objectives."" Iranian drone sales to Russia 'would violate UN resolution' Thursday 13 October 2022 14:59 , Emily Atkinson Any sale of Iranian drones to Russia would be a violation of the UN resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, Frances foreign ministry has warned. The ministry added that it was coordinating with its EU partners on how to respond. Three drones operated by Russian forces attacked the small town of Makariv, west of Ukraines capital, early on Thursday, with officials saying that critical infrastructure facilities were struck by what they said were Iranian-made suicide drones.

Russian nationalist commentators and state media war correspondents lauded Monday's attack as an appropriate, and long-awaited, response to a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and a weekend attack on the bridge between Russia and Crimea, the prized Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed in 2014. Many of them argued that Moscow should keep up the intensity of Monday's strikes to win the war now. Some analysts suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin was becoming a hostage of his allies' views on how the campaign in Ukraine should unfold. ""Putins initiative is weakening, and he is becoming more dependent on circumstances and those who are forging the 'victory (in Ukraine) for him,"" Tatyana Stanovaya, founder of the independent R.Politik think tank, wrote in an online commentary Monday.

For weeks, Putin's supporters have called for drastic battlefield steps in Ukraine. The exhortations intensified over the weekend after an explosion on the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia; the bridge, Europe's longest, is a prominent symbol of Russian military might. Putin himself opened the span in 2018. ""And?"" Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's state-funded RT television, wondered on social media about Moscow's response to the Saturday bridge attack. ""This is one of those cases when the country needs to show we can hit back,"" wrote Alexander Kots, a war correspondent for the popular pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. Story continues Senior Russian lawmaker Sergei Mironov, who leads the state-backed A Just Russia party, tweeted Saturday that Moscow should disregard Western opinion in formulating its answer to the conspicuous attack. ""It is time for fighting! Fiercely, even cruelly. Without looking back at whatever censures from the West,"" Mironov tweeted Saturday. ""There won't be any bigger sanctions. They won't say any worse words. We need to do our thing. We started it -- we should go till the end. There is no way back. Time to respond!"" The response came Monday morning, when Russia simultaneously launched dozens of missiles at Ukrainian cities, killing and wounding scores and inflicting unprecedented damage on Ukraine's critical infrastructure. The strikes, which hit 15 Ukrainian cities, most of them regional capitals, knocked out power lines, damaged railway stations and roads, and left cities without water supplies. For the first time in months, Russian missiles exploded in the heart of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, in dangerous proximity to government buildings. Putin said Monday the strikes were in retaliation for what he called Kyivs ""terrorist"" actions targeting the Kerch Bridge, and vowed a ""tough"" and ""proportionate"" response should Ukraine carry out further attacks that threaten Russia ""No one should have any doubts about it,"" he said. ""Here comes the response,"" RT's Simonyan tweeted on Monday after the attacks. ""The Crimean bridge was that very red line from the very beginning."" Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of Chechnya, a Russian region in the North Caucasus, said he was now ""100% happy"" with the course of the Kremlin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Kadyrov was among the most ardent proponents of ""more drastic measures,"" including the use of low-yield nuclear weapons. The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, described Monday's strikes as ""good news."" The cheering by Kremlin supporters came with demands for Putin and the Russian military to keep up the pace and intensity of the attacks and the damage inflicted on Ukraine's infrastructure. Aksyonov said that ""had such actions to destroy the enemy's infrastructure been taken every day, then we would have finished everything in May and the Kyiv regime would have been defeated."" ""I hope that now the pace of the operation will not slow down,"" Aksyonov wrote. RT's top host, Anton Krasovsky, posted a video of himself Monday dancing on a balcony in a cap bearing a Z, the symbol that Russian forces painted on military vehicles while invading Ukraine. In another Telegram post, he said the damage to Ukraine's power lines was ""not enough! Not enough!"" Another state TV journalist, Andrei Medvedev, called Monday's attacks ""a logical step, which not just the society has long demanded -- the military situation demanded a different approach to the hostilities."" ""And so it happened. But does it change much?"" Medvedev, who works for Russia's state TV group VGTRK and holds a seat on the Moscow City Council, wrote on Telegram. ""If the strikes on the critical infrastructure become regular, if the strikes on railways, bridges and power plants become part of our tactics, then yes, it does change (the situation),"" Medvedev wrote. ""But for now, according to (official) statements, a decision to plunge Ukraine into medieval times has not been made,"" Political analyst Stanovaya said in a Telegram post that Putin had faced ""powerful pressures"" before Monday's bombardment ""to move onto aggressive actions, massive bombings,"" and that prompted the Russian leader to act. ""As of today, one can say that Putin was persuaded to resort to a more aggressive line. And it corresponds with his understanding on the situation. But it is a slippery slope -- there is no way back,"" Stanovaya wrote. ___ Follow the APs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/kremlin-war-hawks-demand-more-062155036.html

Of the U.N.s 193-member body, 143 voted in favor of the resolution criticizing Russias ""illegal so-called referendums,"" with 35 abstaining, according to an update. Syria, North Korea, Belarus and Nicaragua joined Russia as the five opposing votes. The opposition club is nearly the same as the five votes in March against resolution condemning Russias invasion of Ukraine: Syria, North Korea and Belarus joined Russia both times. Eritrea voted against condemning the invasion back in March, while Nicaragua voted against condemning the annexation Wednesday. The now-passed resolution calls on the U.N.s member states not to recognize Russias annexation move -- and calls for Russia to rescind its claims over the Ukrainian land. Moscow made the controversial move to hold Russian-controlled referendums and annex parts of Ukraine amid a number of battlefield setbacks, including a counteroffensive from Ukraine that forced Russian troops to the border in some areas. The U.S. and its allies worked to gather support ahead of the resolution vote, hoping to get at least as many ballots in favor as the 100 that backed a 2014 resolution against Russias annexation of Crimea. The high count in favor, no lower than the vote earlier this year to condemn the invasion, indicates the international support for Ukraine has not lost ground as the conflict continues through its eighth month. China, India, South Africa and Pakistan were among the 35 abstaining from Wednesdays vote.

Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made the announcement Thursday shortly after the Russia-backed leader of Kherson asked the Kremlin to organize evacuation from four cities, citing the danger from missile strikes. Vladimir Saldo said ""these missile strikes cause serious damage, first and foremost to the residents and that missiles also hit ""hotels, residential buildings, markets, (places) where there are lots of civilians."" Saldo said a decision has been made to evacuate residents of Kherson, Nova Kakhovka, Hola Prystan and Chornobaivkato to the Russian regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol, as well as to annexed Crimea. Russia has characterized the movement of Ukrainians to Russia as voluntary but reports have surfaced that many have been forcibly deported from occupied territory, to ""filtration camps"" where harsh conditions have been reported. Ukrainian forces are pushing their counteroffensive deeper into the southern region, one of four that Russia recently annexed illegally. In a separate statement, Saldos deputy Kirill Stremousov tried to play down the announced evacuation, saying that ""no ones retreating ... no one is planning to leave the territory.""

""It hasnt improved in any way, he said on Thursday evening in Kyiv shortly after returning from Russia. The International Atomic Energy Agency keeps pushing for a demilitarization zone around the nuclear plant, which means ""no attack against the plant and the plant not to be used as a tool to attack,"" Grossi explained. The plant is in an area occupied by Russia but those working at the plant are Ukrainian. At the same time, he said the IAEA believes Russians want to create the security, because ""they are working with him."" However, Grossi said he still didnt receive any indications from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is ready to discuss with IAEA the definitive ""parameters"" that will allow finding a safe solution for the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe amid the war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that he met with Grossi in a bomb shelter in Kyiv ""while Russian terrorists kept firing missiles at Ukraine."" His post included a photo of the two men meeting in what appeared to be an underground room with pipes hanging from the ceiling. ""I reiterated that Russia must withdraw from the ZNPP to ensure its nuclear safety and security, immediately stop abductions and intimidation of the Ukrainian personnel,"" he tweeted. ___ BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would be crossing a ""very important line"" if he were to order the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as the military alliance and Russia are both due to hold nuclear exercises in the coming days. NATO is holding its exercise, dubbed ""Steadfast Noon"" next week. The long-planned maneuvers are conducted around the same time every year and run for about one week. It involves fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but doesnt involve any live bombs. Russia usually holds its own maneuvers around the same time. Stoltenberg said Thursday NATO will ""closely monitor"" what Russia is up to. Asked what NATO would do if Russia launched a nuclear attack, Stoltenberg said: ""We will not go into exactly how we will respond, but of course this will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will mean that a very important line has been crossed."" ___ LISBON, Portugal -- Portugal is sending six of its Russian-built firefighting helicopters to Ukraine to help fend off Russian forces. Portuguese Defense Minister Helena Carreiras said Thursday the Kamov helicopters cant fly in Portugal because European Union sanctions prevent them being given an air worthiness certificate. She added that one of the choppers also needs spare parts which cant be imported. She said Ukrainian authorities ""warmly welcomed"" news they would be getting the aircraft. ___ LISBON, Portugal -- Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has defended decisions made during her time in power to buy natural gas from Russia. Merkel said at an award ceremony in Lisbon on Thursday that ""you always act in the time you are in"" and she doesnt regret decisions she made. She said Germany needed to diversify its energy supplies as it moved away from nuclear and coal-fueled power generation and that gas would be needed for the transitional period. Merkel said ""from the perspective of that time, it was very rational and understandable to get pipeline gas, including from Russia, that was cheaper than LNG from other parts of the world."" But the former German leader said Russia's ""brutal attack"" on Ukraine is ""a turning point, and the new government of course has to deal with that."" Merkel led Germany from 2005 until last December. Russia was Germanys main gas supplier when she left office; that has changed this year, and Russia halted supplies through the main Nord Stream 1 pipeline at the end of August. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine and Russia say 20 soldiers on both sides have been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all. ""As a result of the negotiation process on the exchange today, 20 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime,"" the Russian Ministry of Defense said. The soldiers are being provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance and would soon be taken to the Ministry of Defenses medical facilities for treatment and rehabilitation. Ukraine also said its 20 soldiers have been freed from captivity in Olenivka, in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They are now undergoing medical checkups. The head of the Ukrainian presidents office, Andriy Yermak, vowed on Telegram: ""We will bring everyone back.""

France will soon deliver more cannons, radar and anti-aircraft missiles to help protect Ukraine from drone and missiles strikes, Macron told TV broadcaster France 2 on Wednesday evening. Macron emphasized on Thursday that the arms shipments are aimed at ""helping Ukraine to resist on its own soil, never to attack Russia."" ""We do not want a world war,"" he said in a Twitter post. The French president who had tried hard to prevent the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine and travelled to Moscow to talk Putin out of the war, insists that dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv should resume despite recent escalation on the battlefield. ""I hope as soon as possible ... there will be peace discussion with Ukraine on one side, and Russia on the other,"" Macron said. ___ BRUSSELS -- Ukrainian entries dominated Thursdays shortlist to win European Unions top human rights prize. The Christian Democrat, Socialist and Liberal groups, the three biggest within the European parliament, all nominated the people of Ukraine as their choice to win the Sakharov Prize this year for their resistance to the Russian invasion. On top of that, the conservative ECR group specifically named Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as their favorite for his endurance and defense of his people. The overwhelming support for the Ukraine cause reduced other nominees to outsiders, including Brazil environmental activist Sonia Guajajara and imprisoned WikiLeaks activist Julian Assange. The winner of the prize will be announced Wednesday. ___ VELYKA OLEKSANDRIVKA, Ukraine - In this small town in southern Ukraine that has been retaken in a Ukrainian counteroffensive, signs of Russian occupation and fighting are clearly visible. The village is in the Kherson region, which Moscow illegally annexed following referendums described as sham by Ukraine and the West. Now wrestled away from Russias hold, the town is fraction of what it used to be. Bridges have been blasted into pieces and blackened vehicles are left on damaged roads. Public buildings and private homes bear the scars of shelling. Tattered Ukrainian blue and yellow flags flew outside of municipal centers - sign of defiance against the Russian occupiers. Ukraine recaptured the town of 7,000 people a week ago, but residents say they are still struggling to recover from the occupation. Constant threat of shelling and the fear of Russian soldiers breaking into homes and demanding information about Ukraines army were unbearable, said Oleksandr Soltan, 58. Tetyana Patsuks house was struck a month ago during the fighting, and turned into a pile of rubble. Her living room sofa stuck out from under the debris. ""Its a disaster,"" the 72-year-old woman said. ""Ive been crying for a month. I am still shocked. I cant recover from that feeling that I have lost everything now ... and thats it. I was left with nothing."" Patsuks basement was used as a shelter for her and her neighbors during the heaviest bombardments. ""There is no house which was not damaged by them (Russians),"" she said. ___ ASTANA, Kazakhstan - Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed turning Turkey into a gas hub for Europe after deliveries were halted through the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Putin floated the idea to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan. There was no immediate comment from Erdogan. Putins spokesman Dimitry Peskov said that Turkey has reacted positively to the idea. Plunging Russian gas supplies have caused prices to soar, driving inflation, pressuring governments to help ease the pain of sky-high energy bills for households and businesses and raising fears of rationing and recession. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has received $1.3 billion in additional emergency financing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Thursday. He said on Telegram that the funds would be used ""to finance priority needs: strengthening defense capabilities, paying pensions, social programs and supporting the economy"". According to Shmyhal, the IMF has given Ukraine $2.7 billion since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion on Feb. 24. ___ Kremlin-backed authorities in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, illegally annexed by Moscow last month, announced on Thursday that separatist troops together with the Russian army have retaken two settlements, Opytne and Ivanhrad. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials on the development. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties last month absorbing Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions into Russia in defiance of international law. ___ BRUSSELS -- NATOs secretive Nuclear Planning Group met Thursday as the military alliance presses ahead with plans to hold a nuclear exercise next week as concerns deepen over President Vladimir Putins insistence that he will use any means necessary to defend Russian territory. Defense ministers led the session, which usually happens once or twice a year, at NATO headquarters in Brussels. It comes against a backdrop of high tension as some NATO allies, led by the U.S., supply Ukraine with advanced weapons and munitions to defend itself against Russian aerial attacks. NATO is keeping a wary eye on Russias movements, but has so far seen no change in its nuclear posture. But additional uncertainty comes from the fact that Russia is also due to hold its own nuclear exercises soon, possibly at the same time as NATO or just after, according to NATO diplomats. That could complicate the 30-country military organizations reading of the war and of Moscows intentions. ___ MOSCOW -- Russian officials say Ukrainian forces have shelled a western region inside Russia near the border with Ukraine. The governor of Russias Belgorod region said Thursday Ukrainian attacks damaged a residential building in the city of Belgorod - the regions administrative center - while an unexploded projectile landed on a school sports ground. Vyacheslav Gladkov said a nearby village was also shelled but there were no injuries. The reports of shelling within Russia came as the speaker of Russias lower house of parliament threatened an even tougher response to what he describes as Kyivs ""terror attacks."" Parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on Telegram that Russia struck more than 70 energy facilities in Ukraine this week and that the ""response will be even tougher"" if Ukrainian attacks continue. --- BRUSSELS -- Germanys defense minister says 15 countries have agreed to move ahead with plans for an improved European air defense system. Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO defense ministers that a letter of intent was signed Thursday to organize joint procurement for the so-called European Sky Shield, under German coordination. She didnt list the other countries involved. German news agency dpa reported that representatives of the U.K., Slovakia, Norway, Latvia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia attended the signing ceremony. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's presidential office says 13 people have been killed and 37 others wounded in the past 24 hours as the result of Russian attacks throughout the country. Rescuers going through the rubble following Russias attack on the southern city of Mykolaiv have found a man who died under the rubble. Local authorities say a Russian missile hit a river boat station, killing a worker there. Numerous villages in the region were also shelled, leaving many houses damaged but no apparent casualties. Also Thursday, the local administrator in the Zaporizhzhia region says Russian attacks killed one person there and wounded over a dozen, while also damaging civilian infrastructure and buildings. ___ KYIV, Ukraine - Ukraine says it has shot down six Iranian-made drones in the south of the country which were also used for attacks in the Kyiv region on Thursday morning. Ukrainian forces downed overnight the Shahed-136 drones above Odesa and Mykolaiv, the Air Force Command of Ukrainian Armed Forces said. In Kyiv, the drones hit an infrastructure object for three times early on Thursday, officials said. The attack caused a fire but no casualties, regional Gov. Oleksii Kuleba said. Ukraines Center for National Resistance says Russian forces have invited instructors from Iran to help them operate the Shahed-136. ___ BRUSSELS -- Britain says that it will provide missiles for advanced NASAM anti-aircraft systems that the Pentagon plans to send to Ukraine in coming weeks. Britain is also sending hundreds of additional aerial drones for information gathering and logistics support, plus 18 more howitzer artillery guns, the U.K. defense secretary said Thursday. Ben Wallace says ""these weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defense alongside the U.S. NASAMS.""

['Yuras Karmanau'],Belarus army would likely have little impact in Ukraine war,2022-10-12 08:56:07,"Statements made this week by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have reignited fears that his army could join Russian forces in Moscow's war against Ukraine, but the authoritarian leader appears reluctant to lend his troops to the effort, despite perceived pressure from Moscow. Russia has already used Belarus, its longtime and dependent ally, as a staging ground to send troops and missiles into Ukraine.","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) -- Statements made this week by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have reignited fears that his army could join Russian forces in Moscow's war against Ukraine, but the authoritarian leader appears reluctant to lend his troops to the effort, despite perceived pressure from Moscow. Russia has already used Belarus, its longtime and dependent ally, as a staging ground to send troops and missiles into Ukraine. Analysts say if Belarus' small and inexperienced military gets involved, the additional troops could help Moscow cut off some key transportation corridors, but likely wouldn't significantly boost Russian President Vladimir Putin's capabilities on the battlefield. ""The Belarusian army is weak and demotivated, and it is not willing to fight with Ukraine, which means that Lukashenko will try to give Putin anything but Belarusian soldiers,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ""Lukashenko is letting Putin know: 'I will help, but I wont fight.'"" Lukashenko announced Monday that he and Putin agreed to create a joint ""regional grouping of troops"" and that several thousand Russian soldiers will be stationed in Belarus. Lukashenko offered no details about where the troops will be deployed, and Russia's motives weren't immediately clear, though the remarks come as Moscow is struggling to replenish troops lost on the battlefield. Lukashenko also said that Kyiv is plotting to attack Belarus -- and he cautioned Ukraine against attacking ""even one meter of our territory with their dirty hands."" His defense minister, Viktor Khrenin, also warned Ukraine not to provoke Belarus, saying, ""We dont want to fight"" and stressing a day later, however, that the joint force is for defense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers on Tuesday that Kyiv isn't planning military actions against Belarus. He said Moscow ""is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war."" Story continues Oleksiy Danilov, head of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told Ukrainian television Tuesday that Belarus is being ""held hostage by Russia."" Fears of Russian pressure on Belarus aren't unfounded. Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader, has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 28 years while relying on Russias political and economic support. Moscow has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up Lukashenko's Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans. And in 2020, the Kremlin helped Lukashenko survive the largest mass protests in the countrys history, following a presidential election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged. Lukashenko has publicly supported Russias attack on Ukraine, drawing international criticism and sanctions against Minsk. Still, Lukashenko has repeatedly rejected speculations that Belarus would send its own soldiers to fight alongside Russia. ""Neither the Belarusian elites, nor the population are ready to participate in this incomprehensible war,"" Valery Karbalevich, an independent Belarusian analyst, told the AP. Karbalevich said Lukashenko is trying to bargain, offering to keep Russian nuclear weapons on its soil and create the joint force, while also hinting at the weakness of his own army. Part of Belarus' 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) border with northwest Ukraine lies only about 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. Troops coming from Belarus would likely move west and target cities of Lviv and Lutsk, key transportation hubs for Western military supplies, said Zhdanov, the Ukrainian military analyst. ""It is vital for Russia to cut off the transport corridor, because via Lviv, Western weapons reach the east and the south, where the Ukrainian army is conducting a successful counteroffensive, and this can only be done from Belarus,"" Zhdanov said. However, Lukashenkos army is relatively small -- just 45,000 troops, including conscripts -- and largely inexperienced. The Belarusian military holds regular drills, but hasnt taken part in combat since World War II. At best, Minsk will be able to deploy 20,000 troops -- professional contract soldiers, according to Zhdanov. Belarusian military analyst Alexander Alesin said Lukashenko can avoid getting involved by saying that his limited troops are needed to defend Belarus borders from its neighbors -- NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Lukashenko said earlier this year that the Kremlin's campaign in Ukraine ""has dragged on"" and even suggested that he could mediate peace talks, insisting on the need to end the war as soon as possible. Karbalevich said Lukashenko understands that Russia is losing the war and he "" is trying to crawl as far away from Russia as he can."" Lukashenko is also facing public frustration at home, as Belarusians are feeling the effects of crippling Western sanctions and spiking inflation, which is already twice as high as last year. ""After mass protests of 2020, when hundreds of thousands of people demanded that Belarus' leader step down, Lukashenko is afraid of arming Belarusians. It can provoke another domestic explosion,"" Karbalevich said. And, Alesin said, Belarusians are not mentally prepared to fight Ukrainians. ""Unlike the Russians, Belarusians have absolutely no hostility towards the Ukrainians and dont understand the point of this special operation. This may lead to mass refusals to comply with orders to shoot Ukrainians,"" he said. ___ Dasha Litvinova contributed to this report. ___ Follow the APs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/belarus-army-likely-little-impact-085607697.html

YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images Ukrainian forces are now fielding captured T-90 tanks, modern armor taken as Russian troops retreat, the military said. As the Russian military loses more modern equipment, it has been forced to pull old tanks from storage. Tanks are just one example of the kind of heavy weaponry that fleeing Russian forces have abandoned. Russian troops fleeing Ukraine's battlefield advances are leaving behind heavy weapons, including modern T-90 tanks Russia counts among its best main battle tanks, and the Ukrainian armed forces are putting them back into the fight, Kyiv's military said. ""Thanks to the generosity of the russian federation, the first batch of new T-90A tanks entered into service with #UAarmy,"" Ukraine's defense ministry said on social media Thursday, mockingly calling the move ""particularly generous because at the same time the ruscists are launching a program to restore 60-year-old T-62 tanks for their own armed forces."" Russia has touted the T-90, a modern weapon born out of a T-72 modernization program in the final years of the Soviet Union that has been upgraded repeatedly over time, as one of the most advanced tanks in its arsenal, but even with capable tanks, Russian armor forces have faced setbacks and substantial losses in Ukraine. Russian forces have lost lots of modern equipment throughout the devastating war in Ukraine and have been forced to pull old and obsolete tanks -- like the T-62 referenced by Ukraine's military -- from storage. The T-62 is a Soviet-era main battle tank that was eventually replaced by the T-72 and can be seen on display in some museums. Ukrainian soldiers scavenge an abandoned Russian T-90A tank in Kyrylivka, in the recently retaken area near Kharkiv, on September 30, 2022. YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP via Getty Images According to an open-source intelligence analysis by Oryx, Russia, as of Wednesday, has lost over 7,000 vehicles and other forms of heavy weaponry -- like artillery pieces and missile systems -- since its forces invaded Ukraine in late February. This designation includes Russian equipment that's been destroyed, damaged, captured, or abandoned. More specifically, Russia has lost over 1,320 tanks -- of which over 500 have been captured or abandoned. Losses include nearly 30 T-90A and T-90M tanks. Story continues Some observers have speculated that capture of the T-90M, which is an upgraded version of the T-90A, could help provide Ukraine and NATO countries with valuable insight into Russia's advanced military technology, which Russian President Vladimir Putin would probably have preferred remain in Russian hands. Russian military servicemen wear face masks to protect against the coronavirus (COVID-19) and ride a heavy T-90 tank during the first city rehearsals of the Victory Day military parade, on April 29, 2021 in Moscow, Russia. Konstantin Zavrazhin/Getty Images Tanks aren't the only weapons that Russian forces are leaving behind in the face of Ukrainian advances. Moscow's troops have abandoned mountains of high-value weaponry, overwhelming Ukraine's ability to handle it all. And on top of what Ukrainian forces have recovered from Russian troops, Kyiv also continues to enjoy military assistance and security packages from Western countries -- much to the dismay of the Kremlin, which continues to threaten against the support. The Russian military's inability to destroy some of its vehicles or heavy weaponry when its forces retreat is another sign of disfunction on the battlefield and seems to suggest that there's either little to no procedures in place or that they had to flee quickly and didn't have time to neutralize the equipment. Britain's defense ministry said last month that the way Russian forces have retreated seems to vary. ""Some units retreated in relatively good order and under control, while others fled in apparent panic,"" it wrote in an intelligence update. The retreat of Russian forces from key positions has been a relatively common theme since early September, when Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives along the war's eastern and southern fronts. Moscow's military setbacks have forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to take several escalatory steps, including a partial military mobilization and even nuclear threats. The past few days have been particularly turbulent as Russian forces launched several missile and suicide drone attacks on targets across Ukraine -- including cities far from the front lines. The US and its NATO allies are now rushing to provide Ukraine with air defense systems. ""Ukraine is not asking for soldiers from any other country. The Ukrainians are willing to fight for themselves. All they ask for is the means to do it,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters on Wednesday after meeting in Brussels with US allies and partners. ""As President Biden has said and many other national leaders have said, we will do as much as we can for as long as we can, and we will do as much as it takes for as long as it takes,"" he added.

Missile strikes killed at least five people and destroyed an apartment building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, while heavy artillery damaged more than 30 houses, a hospital, a kindergarten and other buildings in the town of Nikopol, across the river from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Russia has intensified its bombardment of civilian areas in recent weeks as its military lost ground in multiple occupied regions of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin has illegally annexed. Kremlin war hawks have urged Putin to escalate the bombing campaign even more to punish Ukraine for Saturday's truck bomb attack on the landmark Kerch Bridge. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. ""We need to protect our sky from the terror of Russia,"" Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskky told the Council of Europe, a human rights organization. ""If this is done, it will be a fundamental step to end the entire war in the near future."" Responding to Zelenskyy's repeated pleas for more effective air defenses, the British government announced it would provide missiles for advanced NASAM anti-aircraft systems that the Pentagon plans to send to Ukraine. The U.K. also is sending hundreds of aerial drones for information-gathering and logistics support, plus 18 howitzer artillery guns. ""These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defense alongside the U.S. NASAMS,"" U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said. Other NATO defense ministers meeting this week promised to supply systems offering medium- to long-range defense against missile attacks. Story continues Germany has delivered the first of four promised IRIS-T air defense systems, while France pledged more artillery, anti-aircraft systems and missiles. The Netherlands said it would send missiles, and Canada is planning about $50 million more in military aid, including winter equipment, drone cameras and satellite communications. Speaking in Berlin, German German Olaf Scholz said Putin ""and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine,"" but rather ""a crusade against our way of life and a crusade against what Putin calls the collective West. He means all of us."" NATO plans to hold a nuclear exercise next week against the backdrop of Putins insistence he would use any means necessary to defend Russian territory, including the illegally annexed regions of Ukraine. The exercise takes place each year. On the battlefield Thursday in Ukraine, Russian forces hit a five-story apartment building in Mykolaiv with an S-300 missile, regional Gov. Vitaliy Kim said, a weapon ordinarily used for targeting military aircraft. An 11-year-old boy was pulled alive from the building's rubble after six hours but later died. ""No words. Creature terrorists,"" Kim wrote on Telegram. Video showed rescuers working by flashlight to pull the boy out of the concrete and metal debris. As they carried him on a stretcher through the building's front door to an ambulance, a man who appeared to be his father leaned over to kiss the boy's head, then place a blanket on him. Four other people were reported killed in Mykolaiv. Residents of Ukraine's capital region, whose lives had regained some normalcy when war's front lines moved east and south months ago, were jolted by air raid sirens multiple times Thursday after explosives-packed Iran-made drones found their targets. Ukrainian officials said Iranians in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were training Russians how to use the Shahed-136 systems, which can conduct air-to-surface attacks, electronic warfare and targeting. The low-flying drones keep Ukraines cities on edge, but the British Defense Ministry said theyre unlikely to strike deep into Ukrainian territory because many are destroyed before hitting their targets. Ukraines air force command said Thursday its air defense units shot down six drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions during the night. Ukrainian authorities also reported knocking down four Russian cruise missiles. Describing the scope of Russia's retaliatory attacks, the speaker of Russias lower house of parliament said Russian forces struck more than 70 energy facilities in Ukraine this week. State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin threatened an ""even tougher"" response to future Ukrainian attacks. The 12-mile Kerch Bridge is a prominent symbol of Moscows power. Kyiv's troops have recaptured villages and towns in a fall offensive but that has been revealing the trauma of residents who lived for months under Russian occupation. In one liberated town, Velyka Oleksandrivka in the annexed Kherson region, seven months of Russian occupation left bridges blasted into pieces, blackened vehicles on pockmarked roads and shelling scars on buildings. ""Its a disaster,"" resident Tetyana Patsuk said of her house. ""Ive been crying for a month. I am still shocked. I cant recover from that feeling that I have lost everything now that I am 72 years old, and thats it."" As Ukraine's military claimed more success Thursday in forcing its enemy to retreat from Kherson-area positions, Moscow authorities promised free accommodation to Kherson residents who choose to evacuate to Russia. The Russia-backed leader of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, cited possible missile attacks on civilians in suggesting the move. Saldos deputy, Kirill Stremousov tried to play down the move, saying, ""No ones retreating ... no one is planning to leave the territory of the Kherson region."" But the British military suggested the move reflected Russian fears that fighting was coming right into the city of Kherson. Russia has repeatedly characterized the movement of Ukrainians to Russia as voluntary but reports have surfaced that many have been forcibly deported from occupied territory to Russian ""filtration camps,"" under harsh conditions. In most cases, the only way out of the camps is to Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Among those forced out have been children. An Associated Press investigation found that officials have deported Ukrainian children without consent, lied to them that their parents didn't want them, used them for propaganda, changed their citizenship to Russian and gave some to Russian families. On the Russian side of the border, the Ukrainian military blew up an ammunition depot and damaged a multi-story building in Russias Belgorod region, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The village where the depot is located was evacuated. The director general of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog said Thursday that fighting around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, remained ""concerning."" A Russian missile strike on a distant electrical substation Wednesday caused the plant temporarily to lose its last external power source, which is needed to prevent reactors from overheating. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said in Kyiv after returning from Russia that his organization is pushing for a demilitarization zone around the plant, but that said he did not receive any indications that Putin was ready to discuss the definitive ""parameters"" of such an agreement. ___ Yesica Fisch in Velyka Oleksandrivka, Ukraine, Lorne Cook in Brussels and Suzan Fraser in Ankara contributed to this report. --- Follow the APs coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-kyiv-area-hit-iranian-050716918.html

The ministry said 43 settlements were liberated in the Donetsk region and seven in the Luhansk region.","AFP Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow was conducting its nearly eight-month invasion of Ukraine correctly, despite his forces' early failure to topple Kyiv and a string of recent embarrassing battlefield defeats. But his comments came hours after Kremlin-installed officials in Ukraine's southern region of Kherson urged residents to leave, pointing to nearing Ukrainian artillery and as Kyiv announced its forces were pushing closer towards the region's main city. And on Thursday Moscow also hinted at the potentially wide extent of the damage dealt to the Crimea bridge, saying it could take many months to complete repairs after a recent blast rocked the key supply link between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula. ""What is happening today is not pleasant. But all the same, (if Russia hadn't attacked on February) we would have been in the same situation, only the conditions would have been worse for us,"" Putin told reporters after a summit in the capital of Kazakhstan. ""So we're doing everything right,"" he insisted. Nearly eight months into Moscow's war, Ukraine's emboldened military, which is clawing back territory in the east as well as in the south, was celebrating Defender's Day. Meanwhile a United Nations envoy alleged Russian forces were using rape as a weapon. Putin described the explosion on the Crimea bridge on Saturday as a ""terrorist"" act and in retaliation battered Ukraine for two days with missiles that hit energy facilities and caused blackouts and disruption to water supplies. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he said that ""for now"" he saw no need to continue the massive salvo of missiles that hit cities across Ukraine -- several far from the front line -- and left at least 20 civilians dead. He explained the Russian military had other objectives. - 'The world is with us' - ""Our aim is not to destory Ukraine,"" Putin added. The Crimea bridge is logistically crucial for Moscow. It is a vital transport link for moving military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. But it is also symbolically important to Putin, who inaugurated the bridge in 2018 several years after he annexed the peninsula from Ukraine to a chorus of Western condemnation. The missile barrage on Monday and Tuesday, he said, was direct retaliation for the blast. Russia's cabinet, in a decree signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, ordered the company tasked with the ""design and restoration of destroyed elements of ... the Crimean Bridge"" to complete the work by July 1, 2023. That date gives an indication of the extent of the damage caused by the explosion at the bridge because Russian officials have otherwise been circumspect about the lasting impact of the incident. They did however say hours after the blast -- which they blamed on Ukraine special forces -- that both road and rail traffic had been restored. In Kyiv on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed, during events marking the country's first Defender's Day celebrations, that Ukrainian troops would be victorious over Russian forces He also laid a wreath at a memorial for soldiers killed since 2014, when Kremlin-backed separatists wrested control of parts of two eastern regions. In February this year, the separatists appealed for Russia to intervene. ""The world is with us, more than ever. This makes us stronger than ever in history,"" Zelensky added in reference to unprecedented Western aid. Ukrainian forces mounted a counter-offensive in the south towards the end of the summer and have been pushing closer and closer to the main city in the Kherson region, also called Kherson. On Friday, the Moscow-installed authorities in the region renewed a call for residents to temporarily leave, with reports that Ukrainian forces had been gaining ground near Kherson. - Advance on Kherson - ""The bombardments of the Kherson region are dangerous for civilians,"" Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the pro-Russian regional administration said. He urged residents to take a trip for ""rest and recreation"" elsewhere. But in the east, pro-Russian forces said they were closing in on the industrial city of Bakhmut after they reported the capture of two villages on the city's outskirts this week. An official of the so-called Lugansk People's Republic, a pro-Kremlin breakaway region in east Ukraine, said ""active hostilities were underway"" within Bakhmut. ""Our forces are confidently marching and liberating this settlement,"" the official, Andriy Marochko, was quoted as saying by Russia's state-run TASS news agency. Also this week, UN envoy Pramila Patten told AFP in an interview that rapes and sexual assaults attributed to Moscow's forces in Ukraine were part of a Russian ""military strategy"" and a ""deliberate tactic to dehumanise the victims"". ""When you hear women testify about Russian soldiers equipped with Viagra, it's clearly a military strategy,"" the UN special representative on sexual violence said on Thursday.

But Putin - who has said he would be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia's ""territorial integrity"" - also warned of a ""global catastrophe"" in the event of a direct clash of NATO troops with Russia. He was speaking after a week when Russia has staged its heaviest missile attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities since the start of its invasion of Feb. 24 - an action that Putin has said was retaliation for an attack that damaged a Russian bridge to unilaterally annexed Crimea. ""We do not set ourselves the task of destroying Ukraine. No, of course not,"" Putin said. He said there was ""no need for massive strikes"" now because most designated targets had been hit. Russia's faltering invasion has confronted Putin with the deepest crisis of his 22 years as Russia's paramount leader, as even loyal Kremlin allies have attacked his generals' failings and the chaotic nature of the mobilisation.

""Russia has around 300 Iranian drones and seeks to receive more,"" while Kyivs troops are learning how to shoot down the drones, Resnikov said. NATO Nuclear Exercise to Run Through Oct. 30 (1:11 p.m.) Air forces from across NATO will practice nuclear deterrence capabilities with dozens of aircraft over north-western Europe from Monday, the alliance said on Friday. The annual drills are a ""routine, recurring training activity and it is not linked to any current world events,"" NATO said. ""Steadfast Noon"" involves 14 countries and up to 60 aircraft of various types. Training flights will take place over Belgium, which is hosting the exercise, as well as over the North Sea and the United Kingdom. Defense Ministry Says 1,235 Russian Missiles Fired at Ukraine (12:22 p.m.) Russia has fired 776 Iskander-type, ground-launched missiles, 228 Kalibr sea-launched missiles, and 231 air-launched cruise missiles since the invasion started in February, Ukraines defense minister said on Twitter. Officials in Kyiv had called repeatedly for more help from Western allies to shore up their missile defence. Lithuania Gets US Battalion Deployment Through 2025 (12:03 p.m.) A US battalion will remain in Lithuania through 2025 after approval of a rotational force plan in Washington, Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said after talks with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The US has been rotating a full combat battalion and reinforcement units in Lithuania since 2019. Additional US troops have been deployed there this year in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine. Erdogan Agrees With Putin to Set Up Gas Hub in Turkey (11 a.m.) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed with his Russian counterpart to establish an international gas distribution hub in Turkey. Erdogan said the Thrace region, Turkeys door to Europe, is the most suitable place for it and the work will start without delay. Putin introduced the idea of turning Turkey into a ""gas hub"" on Tuesday at the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow. Moscow plans to transfer to the Black sea volumes lost from the suspension of service on, and blast damage to, the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic Sea. UN Atomic Chief 'Moving Closer to Zaporizhzhia Security Zone (10:42 a.m.) Rafael Mariano Grossi, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said hes ""moving closer to the establishment of a protection zone"" for the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as he left Ukraine. Grossi held talks this week with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""The plants situation is untenable and we need immediate action to protect it,"" Grossi said in a Twitter post. Russia Orders Crimea Bridge Repaired by July (10:40 a.m.) Work to restore a flagship Russian bridge to Crimea damaged by an explosion must be completed by July 1, according to a government document signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The 19-kilometer (12-mile) span across the Kerch Strait is the only road and rail link from Russia to the Black Sea peninsula Putin annexed in 2014. Moscow blamed Ukrainian military intelligence for the Oct. 8 blast on the bridge, which has has been critical for the Kremlin to resupply its forces in Crimea and Ukraines southern Kherson region. Ukraine Expected to Get 5B Euros From EU in Three Tranches (10:07 a.m.) The European Union is set to release 2 billion euros ($1.95 billion) in funds to Ukraine within days, with further tranches of EUR2.5 billion euros and EUR500 million in the second half of November and December respectively, according to the people familiar with the matter. The funds are part of a EUR9 billion financial assistance package that the bloc first announced in the spring. The payments have been mostly delayed due to haggling between member countries over the terms of the package. Musk Warns He Cannot Help Fund Starlink in Ukraine Indefinitely (9:37 a.m.) Elon Musk warned SpaceX cannot indefinitely help carry the cost of high-speed broadband internet for Ukraine. His comments came days after a furor over his comments suggesting Kyiv cede territory in exchange for peace with Russia. SpaceX ""is not asking to recoup past expenses"" on Starlink services in Ukraine, Musk said on Twitter, but it also cannot sustain the financial support or send thousands more terminals to Ukraine. The Starlink terminals in Ukraine are using data as much as 100 times the amount of typical households, Musk added. A week ago he tweeted that Starlink in Ukraine had cost SpaceX $80 million, which would likely surpass $100 million by the end of the year.

['Mark Trevelyan'],"With Putin under pressure, Belarus edges closer to joining war in Ukraine",2022-10-12 16:19:44,"A flurry of military activity in Belarus this week has caught the attention of Ukraine and the West as a potential sign that President Alexander Lukashenko may commit his army in support of Russia's flailing war effort in Ukraine. Lukashenko has ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukraine border, and his defence ministry says ""combat readiness"" drills are under way. On Tuesday, the interior ministry held exercises to eliminate ""sabotage groups"" near Yelsk, only 20 km (12 miles) from the border with Ukraine.","By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) - A flurry of military activity in Belarus this week has caught the attention of Ukraine and the West as a potential sign that President Alexander Lukashenko may commit his army in support of Russia's flailing war effort in Ukraine. Lukashenko has ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukraine border, and his defence ministry says ""combat readiness"" drills are under way. On Tuesday, the interior ministry held exercises to eliminate ""sabotage groups"" near Yelsk, only 20 km (12 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked the Group of Seven (G7) countries to place an international observer mission near the border, while France warned Belarus it could face more Western sanctions if it deepened its involvement in Ukraine. Belarus allowed itself to be used as a launchpad for Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine but has not joined the fighting directly. Analysts say Lukashenko would have no choice but to comply if Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded he enter the war, at a moment when Moscow is reeling from a series of defeats and facing unprecedented public criticism of its generals' failings. But they are sceptical that Belarus's intervention would make much of a difference. Its armed forces total just 48,000 personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and have not fought a war in more than 30 years of independence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. ""It's not exactly a combat-tested armed force,"" said Samir Puri, author of ""Russia's Road to War with Ukraine"". He said, however, that the risk of intervention by Belarus could force Ukraine to beef up security in the north of the country, drawing forces away from the frontlines with Russia in the south and east. Zelenskiy's call for foreign observers is a sign that Ukraine takes the risk seriously but it may not be diplomatically feasible, Puri said. It's unclear who would provide such a force, as Moscow would veto any U.N. role and NATO or EU observers could be drawn into clashes with Russian forces. Story continues The Belarusian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday it said the deployment with Russian troops was a defensive measure ""aimed at responding adequately to actions near our borders"". CLOSER TO NATO Belarus shares borders with three NATO members, a factor that may also be part of Putin's calculations as he seeks to draw his ally into the war. ""It brings him much closer to NATO's borders. Putin can then say: 'I'm bringing the war to you. Do you really want it?' What happens if a missile goes astray?"" a senior European official said. Lukashenko has not specified the size and role of the joint force he announced on Monday, though he said then that he expected the arrival of thousands of troops on Belarusian territory. Not all the evidence suggests the Belarus military is on the verge on joining the fight. The Belarusian Hajun project, which monitors military movements, said there is evidence of equipment moving in the other direction, including the transfer to Russia of at least two trains with 28 Belarusian tanks. Pavel Slunkin, a former Belarusian diplomat now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said there were no signs of Russia pouring forces into the country to re-invade Ukraine from the north, as it did at the start of the war in February. He said he did not believe Lukashenko was on the point of committing his forces to fight alongside Russia's, but he may be readying himself for that eventuality. ""Maybe he hasnt decided it yet but he understands that this could happen and in this scenario its better to have the army prepared."" Slunkin said Lukashenko, who survived mass protests with Russian help in 2020 and depends on Putin both politically and economically, would be in no position to withhold military support if the Kremlin required it. ""His guarantee of keeping his power very much depends on Putin,"" he said. ""Lukashenko can't survive without Russia's support and without repression. His dependence is so deep, he has almost no space for manoeuvre.""

During a Pentagon briefing, she declined to provide any details about the communication or say to whom the correspondence was sent and when the communications with Musk began.","WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department has gotten a request from SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk to take over funding for his satellite network that has provided crucial battlefield communications for Ukrainian military forces during the war with Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter not yet made public, said the issue has been discussed in meetings and senior leaders are weighing the matter. There have been no decisions. In a statement later Friday, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said, ""We can confirm the Department received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of Starlink, their satellite communications product in Ukraine. We remain in communication with SpaceX about this and other topics."" During a Pentagon briefing, she declined to provide any details about the communication or say to whom the correspondence was sent and when the communications with Musk began. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's Starlink system of more than 2,200 low-orbiting satellites has provided broadband internet to more than 150,000 Ukrainian ground stations. Early Friday, Musk tweeted that it was costing SpaceX $20 million a month to support Ukraines communications needs. In addition to the terminals, he tweeted that the company has to create, launch, maintain and replenish satellites and ground stations. CNN was the first to report the Musk request. The Starlink satellite internets vital role in Ukraines defense cannot be overstated. It has, for example, assisted front-line reconnaissance drone operators in targeting artillery strikes on key Russian assets. A senior military official on Friday made it clear that the U.S. believes the system has proven exceptionally effective on the battlefield. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide U.S. assessment of the Ukrainian battlefield. In a tweet on Friday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podolyak said Ukraine will find a solution to keep Starlink working. Story continues ""Lets be honest. Like it or not, @elonmusk helped us survive the most critical moments of war. Business has the right to its own strategies,"" he tweeted. ""We expect that the company will provide stable connection till the end of negotiations."" In response to multiple questions during the briefing, Singh said the Pentagon was working with the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. ""We know that there is this demand, and (satellite communications) capability ... is needed and we want to be able to ensure that there are stable communications for the Ukrainian forces and for Ukraine."" The request from the world's richest man to have the Pentagon take over the hundreds of millions of dollars he says the system is costing comes on the heels of a Twitter war between Musk and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And in tweets overnight Musk referred to the friction, suggesting it may affect his decision to end his company's largesse in funding the systems. In a Twitter exchange last week, Musk argued that to reach peace Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014. He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status, dropping a bid to join NATO. Musk also started a Twitter poll asking whether ""the will of the people"" should decide if seized regions remain part of Ukraine or become part of Russia. In a sarcastic response, Zelenskyy posted a Twitter poll of his own asking ""which Elon Musk do you like more?"": ""One who supports Ukraine"" or ""One who supports Russia."" Musk replied to Zelenskyy that ""I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world."" Andrij Melnyk, the outgoing Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, responded to Musks original tweet with an obscenity. Its not clear how much of the cost of deploying Starlink satellite uplinks in Ukraine has been covered by U.S. funding. In April, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it had delivered 5,000 of the terminals. The Pentagon had no response to that question. Musk's commitment to spend $44 billion to purchase Twitter ""has to factor into his decision that he can no longer afford to do this for free,"" said retired Army Maj. Gen. John Ferrari, a non-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Musks request that the Pentagon begin to pick up the tab comes as the Space Force and Pentagon have been looking at how commercial vendors will play a role in national security. Musk's threat to withdraw highlights the risk of leaning too much on commercial capabilities, Ferrari said. ""Commercial vendors always get to change their mind, "" Ferrari said, adding that the reliance on Starlink to provide communications for Ukraine also serves as a reminder that the Pentagon has to expand this service beyond SpaceX, he said. ""The government needs many vendors for key capabilities, of course that often means more money, but it is an insurance policy and insurance costs money,"" Ferrari said. In March, commander of U.S. Space Command Army Gen. James Dickinson said that having vendors provide needed capabilities, such as Maxars satellite imagery of stalled Russian convoys, has become essential, because it frees up limited military satellite assets to focus on other things. In his tweets, Musk also raised a question that various vendors and the Pentagon are considering as space becomes a more critical part of wartime operations: If a commercial vendor is assisting the U.S. and is targeted, does the U.S. owe it protection? ""Weve also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" Musk tweeted. ____ Associated Press writer Frank Bajak in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.",https://news.yahoo.com/official-musk-seeks-us-funding-155709740.html

It was the strongest support from the General Assembly for Ukraine and against Russia of the four resolutions it has approved since Russian troops invaded Ukraine Feb. 24.","UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn Russias ""attempted illegal annexation"" of four Ukrainian regions and demand its immediate reversal, a sign of strong global opposition to the seven-month war and Moscows attempt to grab its neighbors territory. The vote in the 193-member world body was 143-5 with 35 abstentions. It was the strongest support from the General Assembly for Ukraine and against Russia of the four resolutions it has approved since Russian troops invaded Ukraine Feb. 24. Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the vote ""amazing"" and ""a historic moment."" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said supporters were ""holding our breaths"" and called it ""a monumental day."" European Union Ambassador Olof Skoog called it ""a great success"" that sends ""a resounding message to Russia that they are and remain isolated."" U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the vote demonstrated the world ""is more united and more determined than ever to hold Russia accountable for its violations."" It is ""a clear message"" that ""Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map"" and it ""cannot change borders by force,"" he said. The Western-sponsored resolution was a response to Russias announced annexation last month of Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow acted following Kremlin-orchestrated ""referendums"" that the Ukrainian government and the West have dismissed as sham votes conducted on occupied land amid warfare and displacement. During two days of speeches at the assembly's resumed emergency special session on Ukraine speaker after speaker accused Russia of violating key principles of the United Nations Charter -- respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all U.N. member nations. There was intense lobbying by supporters of the EU-facilitated resolution ahead of Wednesdays vote. Story continues U.S. envoy Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly before the vote that when the United Nations was established on the ashes of World War II it was built on an idea -- ""that never again would one country be allowed to take anothers territory by force."" Afterward, she told reporters the vote means ""that in the eyes of the world and the United Nations, Ukraine's borders remain the same."" ""The resolution also sends an enormously important signal to Moscow and to everyone: It does not matter if you as a nation are big or small, rich or poor, old or new. If you are a U.N. member state, your borders are your own and are protected by international law,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""They cannot be redrawn by anyone else by force."" A key issue for the resolutions Western backers was how many countries would support it, and the result went beyond their most optimistic expectations. The General Assembly voted 141-5 with 35 abstentions March 2 to demand an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its troops and protection for all civilians. On March 24, it voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on a resolution blaming Russia for Ukraines humanitarian crisis and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival. But the assembly voted by a far smaller margin April 7 to suspend Russia from the U.N.'s Geneva-based Human Rights Council over allegations Russian soldiers in Ukraine engaged in rights violations that the United States and Ukraine have called war crimes. That vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions. A 2014 resolution affirming Ukraines territorial integrity and declaring the referendum that led to Russias annexation of the Crimean Peninsula illegal was adopted by a vote of 100-11 with 58 abstentions. Among the surprise supporters of Wednesday's resolution were the ""yes"" votes from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council as well as Brazil. Russias U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, had appealed to countries to vote against the resolution, calling it ""a politicized and openly provocative document"" and denouncing its sponsors as ""unscrupulous Western blackmailers."" He expressed regret the vote was not by secret ballot, as Russia sought but the assembly rejected. Nebenzia reiterated Russias claims the referendums were valid, saying ""the populations of these regions do not want to return to Ukraine."" The four countries that joined Russia in voting against the resolution were North Korea, Belarus, Syria and Nicaragua. Ukraine's Kyslytsya expressed profound regret that the four countries made ""the wrong choice against the U.N. Charter"" and urged them to reconsider their commitment to the U.N.'s principles. Among the 35 countries that abstained, 19 were from Africa, including South Africa. China and India, the world's two most populous countries, also abstained along with Pakistan and Cuba. The more powerful Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, has been stymied on taking action on Ukraine because of Russias veto power, which it used Sept. 29 to block condemnation of Russias attempts to annex Ukrainian territory. By contrast, the General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, has now approved four resolutions criticizing Russia over Ukraine. Its votes reflect world opinion but are not legally binding. The resolution adopted Wednesday declares that Moscows actions violate Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, are ""inconsistent"" with the principles of the U.N. Charter, and ""have no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alternation of the status of these regions of Ukraine."" It demands that Russia ""immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders."" And it supports ""the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means"" that respect Ukraines sovereignty, territorial integrity and internationally recognized borders. Many countries among the more than 70 speakers urged a negotiated end to the war. The EU's Skoog called the appeal for a peaceful solution ""very important,"" but stressed it must be based on Ukraine's territorial integrity. During Wednesdays debate there was strong support for the resolution. Australian Ambassador Mitch Fifield called Russias attempted annexation ""illegal and a dangerous escalation"" and urged all countries to oppose acts of aggression. Ambassador Fergal Mythen of Ireland said voters in the ""sham"" referendums in the four regions ""faced intimidation by the Russian military and Russias illegitimately appointed authorities."" Cambodian Ambassador Sovann Ke didnt indicate how he would vote but said that ""the forcible annexation of regions from a sovereign country is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter and international laws, which is not acceptable"" and urged that internationally respected borders ""be fully respected."" In the voting, Cambodia supported the resolution. South Koreas ambassador, Hwang Joonkook, gave unequivocal support ""to the sovereignty, political independence and the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" He said his country's ""own painful experiences"" after the 1950-53 Korean War ""can testify that any attempt to divide a nation in any form or method is merely the beginning of lasting very serious troubles, rather than a solution."" On the other side of that divide, North Korean Ambassador Kim Song supported the ""self-determination"" of the people in the four regions annexed by Russia as a right protected in the U.N. Charter and said the results must be respected. He accused the United States and Western countries of ""brutally"" violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya under ""the pretext"" of promoting international peace and security without ever having its actions called into question by the Security Council. He argued that U.S. interference in the internal affairs of countries is continuing in the 21st century. Syrian Ambassador Bassam Sabbagh accused the General Assembly of ""being manipulated flagrantly by some Western countries for their own geopolitical interests"" and urged countries to oppose efforts ""to isolate Russia and to employ double standards.""",https://news.yahoo.com/intense-lobbying-ahead-un-vote-192120378.html

Musk's comment on Twitter came after a media report that SpaceX had asked the Pentagon to pay for the donations of Starlink. The billionaire has been in online fights with Ukrainian officials over a peace plan he put forward which Ukraine says is too generous to Russia. A senior defense official told reporters on Friday that the U.S. Department of Defense would not confirm that ongoing talks with the company were related to payment, but said the Pentagon was ""continuing to talk to SpaceX and other companies about SATCOM capabilities."" The Starlink communications platform has been very ""exceptionally effective on the battlefield"" allowing Ukrainians to support multiple device connections in the combat environment, a senior U.S. military official said. The billionaire who runs Tesla said Starlink says he spends nearly $20 million a month for maintaining satellite services in Ukraine. He recently said that SpaceX had spent about $80 million to enable and support Starlink there. ""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable,"" Musk wrote on Twitter on Friday. ""Weve also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" Musk wrote. CNN reported on Thursday that SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon last month saying it could not continue to fund the Starlink service in Ukraine and it may have to stop funding it unless the U.S. military gives the company tens of millions of dollars a month. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk activated Starlink, satellite broadband service, in Ukraine in late February after internet services were disrupted because of Russia's invasion. SpaceX has since given it thousands of terminals. Story continues Starlink has been a key communications tool for Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russian forces. On Friday, an advisor to the Ukrainian president said Kyiv will find a solution to keep the Starlink internet service working in Ukraine. And Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister, backed him up on Telegram. ""Starlink terminals were working, are working and will work. Do not worry,"" he wrote, adding a smiley face emoji at the end. Ukraine said this week Starlink services helped restore energy and communications infrastructure in critical areas after more than 100 Russian cruise missile attacks Russia calls its intervention in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" and says it does not target civilians. Musk drew widespread criticism from Ukrainians over his peace plan in which he proposed that Ukraine permanently cede the Crimea region to Russia, that new referendums be held under U.N. auspices to determine the fate of Russian-controlled territory, and that Ukraine agree to neutrality. Ukraine says it will never agree to cede land taken by force, and lawful referendums cannot be held in occupied territory where many people have been killed or driven out. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was among those who criticized Musk's proposal. Ukraine's outgoing ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, also condemned the plan in tweet that told Musk in profane terms to go away. Musk, responding to a post referring to the fate of the Starlink service and the ambassador's remark, said: ""Were just following his recommendation."" Republican U.S. Representative Adam Kingzinger cited Musk's comments on Twitter, writing ""if there was ever proof that @elonmusk is playing games this is it. Im not sure someone like this can be trusted to any longer do business with our government."" While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology like Starlink can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve areas where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when natural disasters disrupt communication.

The so-called partial mobilization triggered widespread protests and a mass exodus of civilians fleeing across borders from Finland to Georgia and Mongolia. Fleming, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters, said the Russian population now realizes how Putin has ""misjudged"" the war, and they are ""feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice."" He told RUSI that due to Kyivs ""courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace,"" the country had turned the tide against the Kremlins brutal forces. Speaking to BBCs Radio 4 show earlier in the day, the intelligence chief warned that Putins army was still ""very capable"" of causing damage.

The move suggests that Ukrainian military gains along the southern front are worrying the Kremlin. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made the announcement shortly after the Russia-backed leader of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, asked the Kremlin to organize an evacuation from four cities of the region. Saldo said in a video posted online Thursday that Ukraines missile strikes are causing ""serious damage,"" claiming they had struck hotels, residential buildings and markets.

The plant is in an area occupied by Russia but those working at the plant are Ukrainian. At the same time, he said the IAEA believes Russians want to create the security, because ""they are working with him."" However, Grossi said he still didnt receive any indications from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he is ready to discuss with IAEA the definitive ""parameters"" that will allow finding a safe solution for the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe amid the war.

It is ""a clear message"" that ""Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map"" and it ""cannot change borders by force,"" he said. The Western-sponsored resolution was a response to Russias announced annexation last month of Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow acted following Kremlin-orchestrated ""referendums"" that the Ukrainian government and the West have dismissed as sham votes conducted on occupied land amid warfare and displacement.

U.S. envoy Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly before the vote that when the United Nations was established on the ashes of World War II it was built on an idea -- ""that never again would one country be allowed to take anothers territory by force."" Afterward, she told reporters the vote means ""that in the eyes of the world and the United Nations, Ukraines borders remain the same."" ""The resolution also sends an enormously important signal to Moscow and to everyone: It does not matter if you as a nation are big or small, rich or poor, old or new. If you are a U.N. member state, your borders are your own and are protected by international law,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""They cannot be redrawn by anyone else by force.""

Flame and smoke rise from the Crimean Bridge connecting Russian mainland and the Crimean peninsula over the Kerch Strait, in Kerch, Crimea, Oct. 8, 2022. via Associated Press The Federal Security Service, known by the Russian acronym FSB, said it arrested five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over Saturdays attack that damaged the Kerch Bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula -- a crucial thoroughfare for supplies and travel whose much-ballyhooed construction under Russian President Vladimir Putin cost billions. Advertisement A truck loaded with explosives blew up while driving across the bridge, killing four people and causing two sections of one of the two automobile links to collapse. Ukrainian officials have lauded the explosion on the bridge, but stopped short of directly claiming responsibility for it. The FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, alleged that the suspects were working on orders of Ukraines military intelligence to secretly move the explosives into Russia and forge the accompanying documents. It said the explosives were moved by sea from the Ukrainian port of Odesa to Bulgaria before being shipped to Georgia, driven to Armenia and then back to Georgia before being transported to Russia in a complex scheme to secretly deliver them to the target. Putin alleged that Ukrainian special services masterminded the blast, calling it ""an act of terrorism,"" and responded by ordering a barrage of missile strikes on Ukraine. Advertisement Russias onslaught continued in the Zaporizhzhia region and eponymous city on Wednesday, shattering windows and blowing out doors in residential buildings, municipal council secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said. There were no immediate reports of casualties, though Kurtev warned locals of the possibility of a follow-up attack. Zaporizhzhia, which sits fairly near the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces, has been repeatedly struck with often deadly attacks in recent weeks. It is part of a larger region, including Europes largest nuclear power plant now in Russian control, that Moscow has said it has annexed in violation of international law. The city itself remains in Ukrainian hands. To the south, in a Russian-controlled area of the region, a powerful blast struck the city of Melitopol -- sending a car flying into the air, mayor Ivan Fedorov said. There was no word on casualties. The new clashes came two days after Russian forces began pummeling many parts of Ukraine with more missiles and munition-carrying drones, killing at least 19 people on Monday alone in an attack that the U.N. human rights office described as ""particularly shocking"" and amounting to potential war crimes.

Russian nationalist commentators and state medias war correspondents lauded Mondays attack as an appropriate, and long-awaited, response to Ukraines successful counteroffensive in the northeast and the south and a weekend attack on a key bridge between Russia and Crimea, the prized Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed in 2014.

Diplomats struck the deal in Brussels that also includes curbs on EU exports of aircraft components to Russia and limits on steel imports from the country, according to an official statement from the Czech rotating EU presidency. Advertisement The 27-nation bloc will impose a ban on transporting Russian oil by sea to other countries above the price cap, which the Group of Seven wealthy democracies want in place by Dec. 5, when an EU embargo on most Russian oil takes effect. A specific price for the future cap has yet to be defined. A deal on the price cap was not easy to reach because several EU countries were worried it would damage their shipping industries. More details about the sanctions will be published as soon as Thursday. The new package of sanctions was proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week amid heightened security concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putins nuclear threats and his annexation of parts of Ukraine. ""We have moved quickly and decisively,"" von der Leyen said as she welcomed the deal. ""We will never accept Putins sham referenda nor any kind of annexation in Ukraine. We are determined to continue making the Kremlin pay.""

The Russian leader, in a televised address to the nation aired on Wednesday morning, also warned the West that he isnt bluffing over using all the means at his disposal to protect Russias territory, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to Russias nuclear capability. Putin has previously warned the West not to back Russia against the wall and has rebuked NATO countries for supplying weapons to help Ukraine. Advertisement The total number of reservists to be called up is 300,000, officials said. Only those with relevant combat and service experience will be mobilized, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said. He added that there are around 25 million people who fit this criteria, but only around 1% of them will be mobilized. Putins announcement came against the backdrop of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where Moscows invasion of Ukraine last February has been the target of broad international criticism. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky is due to address the gathering in a prerecorded address on Wednesday. Putin didnt travel to New York. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace described Putins mobilization announcement as ""an admission that his invasion is failing."" Advertisement ""He and his defense minister have sent tens of thousands of their own citizens to their deaths, ill-equipped and badly led,"" Wallace said in a statement. ""No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning this war, the international community are united and Russia is becoming a global pariah."" Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday announced a partial mobilization in Russia as the war in Ukraine reaches nearly seven months and Moscow loses ground on the battlefield. via Associated Press The partial mobilization order came a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold votes on becoming integral parts of Russia -- a move that could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war following Ukrainian successes. The referendums, which have been expected to take place since the first months of the war, will start Friday in the Luhansk, Kherson and partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. The war, which has killed thousands of people, has driven up food prices worldwide and caused energy costs to soar. It has also brought fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe at Europes largest nuclear plant in Ukraines now Russia-occupied southeast. Advertisement In his address, Putin accused the West in engaging in ""nuclear blackmail"" and noted ""statements of some high-ranking representatives of the leading NATO states about the possibility of using nuclear weapons of mass destruction against Russia."" He didnt identify who had made such comments. ""To those who allow themselves such statements regarding Russia, I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,"" Putin said. He added: ""Its not a bluff."" Putin said he has already signed the decree for partial mobilization, which is due to start on Wednesday. A full-scale mobilization would likely be unpopular in Russia and could further dent Putins standing after the recent military setbacks in Ukraine. ""We are talking about partial mobilization, that is, only citizens who are currently in the reserve will be subject to conscription, and above all, those who served in the armed forces have a certain military specialty and relevant experience,"" Putin said. On the referendum plans, Putin noted that Russia-backed authorities of the occupied Ukrainian regions asked the Kremlin to support them in their effort to become part of Russia. Advertisement ""We will do everything to provide safe conditions during referendums, so that people can express their will,"" Putin stressed. Foreign leaders have described the ballots as illegitimate and nonbinding. Zelenskyy said they were a ""sham"" and ""noise"" to distract public attention. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, also said that 5,937 Russian soldiers have died in the Ukraine conflict, far lower than Western estimates that Russia has lost tens of thousands. In his nightly address Zelenskyy said Ukraines commitment to retake areas occupied by Russian forces remained unchanged. ""The situation on the front line clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine,"" he said. ""Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this."" Advertisement Even a partial mobilization is likely to increase dismay among Russians about the war. The Vesna opposition movement called for nationwide protests on Wednesday, saying ""Thousands of Russian men -- our fathers, brothers and husbands -- will be thrown into the meat grinder of the war. What will they be dying for? What will mothers and children be crying for?"" It was unclear how many would dare to protest amid Russias overall suppression of opposition and harsh laws against discrediting soldiers and the military operation. The upcoming referendum votes are all but certain to go Moscows way. In another signal that Russia is digging in for a protracted and possibly ramped-up conflict, the Kremlin-controlled lower of house of parliament voted Tuesday to toughen laws against desertion, surrender and looting by Russian troops. Lawmakers also voted to introduce possible 10-year prison terms for soldiers refusing to fight. If approved, as expected, by the upper house and then signed by Putin, the legislation would strengthen commanders hands against failing morale reported among soldiers. In the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, shelling continued around Europes largest nuclear power plant. Ukrainian energy operator Energoatom said Russian shelling again damaged infrastructure at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and briefly forced workers to start two diesel generators for emergency power to the cooling pumps for one of the reactors.

Observers estimated in recent weeks that Russia controlled about half of Donetsk, and battle lines have changed little since then. What happens in the Donbas could determine the course of the war. If Russia succeeds there, it could free up its forces to grab even more land and dictate the terms of any peace agreement. If Ukraine, on the other hand, manages to pin the Russians down for a protracted period, it could build up the resources for a counteroffensive.

Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP Exhausting the Russians has long been part of the plan for the Ukrainians, who began the conflict outgunned -- but hoped Western weapons could eventually tip the scales in their favor. They are already effectively using heavy howitzers and advanced rocket systems sent by the U.S. and other Western allies, and more is on the way. But Ukrainian forces have said they remain badly outmatched. Ukraines Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said recently that Russian forces were firing 10 times more ammunition than the Ukrainian military. After a failed attempt at a lightning advance on the capital of Kyiv in the opening weeks of the war, Russian forces withdrew from many parts of northern and central Ukraine and turned their attention to the Donbas, a region of mines and factories where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Advertisement Since then, Russia has adopted a slow-and-steady approach that allowed it to seize several remaining Ukrainian strongholds in Luhansk over the course of recent weeks. Zhdanov, the analyst, predicted that the Russians would likely rely on their edge in firepower to ""apply the same scorched earth tactics and blast the entire cities away"" in Donetsk. The same day that Russia claimed it had taken the last major city in Luhansk, new artillery attacks were reported in cities in Donetsk. Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 4, 2022. MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV via Getty Images But Russias approach is not without drawbacks. Moscow has not given a casualty count since it said some 1,300 troops were killed in the first month of fighting, but Western officials have said that was just a fraction of real losses. Since then, Western observers have noted that the number of Russian troops involved in combat in Ukraine has dwindled, reflecting both heavy attrition and the Kremlins failure to fill up the ranks. The limited manpower has forced the Russian commanders to avoid ambitious attempts to encircle large areas in the Donbas, opting for smaller maneuvers and relying on heavy artillery barrages to slowly force the Ukrainians to retreat. Advertisement The military has also relied heavily on separatists, who have conducted several rounds of mobilization, and Western officials and analysts have said Moscow has increasingly engaged private military contractors. It has also tried to encourage the Russian men who have done their tour of duty to sign up again, though its is unclear how successful that has been. While Putin so far has refrained from declaring a broad mobilization that might foment social discontent, recently proposed legislation suggested that Moscow was looking for other ways to replenish the ranks. The bill would have allowed young conscripts, who are drafted into the army for a year and barred from fighting, to immediately switch their status and sign contracts to become full professional soldiers. The draft was shelved amid strong criticism. Some Western officials and analysts have argued that attrition is so heavy that it could force Moscow to suspend its offensive at some point later in the summer, but the Pentagon has cautioned that even though Russia has been churning through troops and supplies at rapid rates it still has abundant resources. U.S. director of national intelligence Avril Haines said Putin appeared to accept the slow pace of the advance in the Donbas and now hoped to win by crushing Ukraines most battle-hardened forces. ""We believe that Russia thinks that if they are able to crush really one of the most capable and well-equipped forces in the east of Ukraine ... that will lead to a slump basically in the Ukrainian resistance and that that may give them greater opportunities,"" Haines said. Advertisement If Russia wins in the Donbas, it could build on its seizure of the southern Kherson region and part of the neighboring Zaporizhzhia to try to eventually cut Ukraine off from its Black Sea coast all the way to the Romanian border. If that succeeded, it would deal a crushing blow to the Ukrainian economy and also create a corridor to Moldovas separatist region of Transnistria that hosts a Russian military base. But that is far from assured. Mykola Sunhurovsky of the Razumkov Center, a Kyiv-based think tank, predicted that growing supplies of heavy Western weapons, including HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, will help Ukraine turn the tide of the war. ""The supplies of weapons will allow Ukraine to start a counteroffensive in the south and fight for Kherson and other cities,"" Sunhurovsky said. But Ukraine has also faced massive personnel losses: up to 200 soldiers a day in recent weeks of ferocious fighting in the east, according to officials. ""Overall, local military balance in Donbas favors Russia, but long term trends still favor Ukraine,"" wrote Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. ""However, that estimate is conditional on sustained Western military assistance, and is not necessarily predictive of outcomes. This is likely to be a protracted war.""

['Politics Reporter'],'Beautiful And Sad At The Same Time': Ukrainian Cultural Festival Takes On A Deeper Meaning This Year,2022-09-19 13:03:18,An annual celebration took on a different feel as Russia's invasion dragged into Day 206.,"SILVER SPRING, Md. -- For some, its hearing air raid sirens while talking with relatives back in Ukraine. For others, its the fear that Ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. Or that the world may forget the countrys plight altogether. Ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country thats fought Russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington for the regions biggest annual Ukrainian cultural festival. Advertisement Amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka -- white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front -- and accompanied by traditional and pop Ukrainian music, the war was never far from peoples minds. What in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning. ""This year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,"" said the church pastor, the Rev. Volodymr Steliac, as he formally opened the festival Saturday. ""We have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity."" The festival opened on Day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for Ukraine: a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared Russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war. But the victory came with a price. In the strategic town of Izium, mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital Kyivs suburb of Bucha when the war began. Advertisement ""We have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity."" - The Rev. Volodymr Steliac, St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral Oksana Sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on Europe. In the past, she said, some people suspected Ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the Russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to Russia. ""Then you see Bucha, you see now Izyum. And we have yet to see Kherson and Mariupol and other places,"" Sukhina said. Sukhina, 50, immigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv in 2020. Warned by former colleagues in the State Department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in Washington only days before the war. Advertisement But as the prospect of Kyivs being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. They joined a 23-year-old son who left his IT job in Chicago in March to help deliver food and medical supplies in Kyiv. Sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014. ""Im proud of them. They are trying to do whatever they can. And this is what makes us win,"" she said. Attendees of the 2022 Washington Ukrainian Festival enjoy traditional music on the grounds of the Saint Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral Saturday Sept. 17. Jonathan Nicholson Steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. He was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to Ukraine. Advertisement In one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in Ukraine. ""The war is not there alone; the war is here as well,"" Steliac said. Even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful. ""What was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, 'Oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesnt go through,"" Steliac said. ""You think of the worst."" Alex Naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from Ternopil in the western part of Ukraine, said hes had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored. Ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. Ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned. ""Im worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents place,"" Naumovych said. Advertisement Naumovych arrived in the U.S. almost 11 years ago. He had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million. ""Im worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents place."" - Alex Naumovych, mortage loan officer originally from Ternopil region of Ukraine ""I love this country. Like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,"" he said. One of his big worries for Ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%. ""The economy is in bad shape,"" Naumovych said. ""A lot of people left Ukraine and Im not sure theyre coming back"" Advertisement The parents of software engineer Serhiy Vorobiov, 43, are near the wars front line in Zaporizhzhya, a Russian-speaking region that includes Europes largest nuclear power plant. Russia has captured the plant and Ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail. But Vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of Zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. He said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war. ""Maybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. I know its not to my defense, but thats how it is,"" he said. Vorobiov, his wife Oksana, 33, and their three young children, Yaromyr, Myroslava and Oksana, have lived in the U.S. since 2020. He said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any Russian influence on their upbringing. ""I always dreamed of it, I just didnt want to be very tough in that. But now I have all the rights and I want to use it,"" Vorobiov said. Advertisement ""I want them to forget [the] Russian language. We are from [the] Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. Forget Russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] Soviet Union.

['The Associated Press'],Kremlin Says 4 Regions Of Ukraine To Be Folded In Russia Friday,2022-09-29 10:28:17,Ukraine and the West have denounced the referendums in the regions as a sham.,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia confirmed on Thursday it will formally annex parts of Ukraine where occupied areas held Kremlin-orchestrated ""referendums"" on living under Moscows rule that the Ukrainian government and the West denounced as illegal and rigged. Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend a ceremony on Friday in the Kremlin when four regions of Ukraine will be officially folded into Russia, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Advertisement Peskov said the pro-Moscow administrators of the regions will sign treaties to join Russia during the ceremony at the Kremlins St. Georges Hall. The official annexation was widely expected following the votes that wrapped up on Tuesday in the areas under Russian occupation in Ukraine and after Moscow claimed residents overwhelming supported for their areas to formally become part of Russia. The United States and its Western allies have sharply condemned the votes as ""sham"" and vowed never to recognize their results. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Thursday joined other Western officials in denouncing the votes. ""Under threats and sometimes even (at) gunpoint people are being taken out of their homes or workplaces to vote in glass ballot boxes,"" she said at a conference in Berlin. Advertisement ""This is the opposite of free and fair elections,"" Baerbock said. ""And this is the opposite of peace. Its dictated peace. As long as this Russian diktat prevails in the occupied territories of Ukraine, no citizen is safe. No citizen is free."" Armed troops had gone door-to-door with election officials to collect ballots in five days of voting. The suspiciously high margins in favor were characterized as a land grab by an increasingly cornered Russian leadership after embarrassing military losses in Ukraine. Moscow-installed administrations in the four regions of southern and eastern Ukraine claimed Tuesday night that 93% of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhzhia region supported annexation, as did 87% in the Kherson region, 98% in the Luhansk region and 99% in Donetsk. Ukraine too has dismissed the referendums as illegitimate, saying it has every right to retake the territories, a position that has won support from Washington. The Kremlin has been unmoved by the criticism. After a counteroffensive by Ukraine this month dealt Moscows forces heavy battlefield setbacks, Russia said it would call up 300,000 reservists to join the fight. It also warned it could resort to nuclear weapons. Advertisement Also on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities said Russian shelling has killed has killed at least eight civilians, including a child, and wounded scores of others. A 12-year-old girl has been pulled out of rubble after an attack on Dnipro, officials said. ""The rescuers have taken her from under the rubble, she was asleep when the Russian missile hit,"" said local administrator Valentyn Reznichenko. Reports of new shelling came as Russia appeared to continue to lose ground around a key northeastern city of Lyman while it struggles to press on with chaotic mobilization of troops and prevent the fighting-age men from leaving the country, according to a Washington-based think-tank and the British intelligence reports. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said Ukrainian forces have taken more villages around Lyman, a city some 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city. The report said Ukrainian forces may soon encircle Lyman entirely, in what would be a major blow to Moscows war effort. ""The collapse of the Lyman pocket will likely be highly consequential to the Russian grouping in northern Donetsk and western Luhansk oblasts and may allow Ukrainian troops to threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk"" region, the institute said. Advertisement The British military intelligence report claimed the number of Russian military-age men fleeing the country likely exceeds the number of forces Moscow used to initially invade Ukraine in February. ""The better off and well educated are over-represented amongst those attempting to leave Russia,"" the British said. ""When combined with those reservists who are being mobilized, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labor and the acceleration of 'brain drain is likely to become increasingly significant.""",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-ukraine-referendums_n_6335716be4b08e0e606ac8a9

""Were coming to a point right now where I think Putin is going to have to revise what his objectives are for this operation,"" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told an intelligence and national security conference outside Washington. ""Because ""its pretty clear right now that hes ... not going to be able to do what he initially intended to do."" Advertisement Putin sent troops into neighboring Ukraine in February with what U.S. officials say was the objective of unseating Ukraines Western-friendly government. Ukrainian forces drove Russian fighters from their positions around Ukraines capital earlier in the war. And Russia suffered another major setback last week, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced its troops back from large swaths of Ukraines northeast. ""The Russians planned for an occupation, not necessarily an invasion, and that has set them back,"" Berrier said, citing Putins reluctance so far to fully mobilize Russian forces to get more manpower into the fight.

Berrier spoke at a panel with other senior officials at the intelligence communitys Intelligence and National Security Summit at National Harbor in Maryland just outside Washington. Asked about concerns that Putin could unleash weapons of mass destruction if hes thwarted on the battlefield by U.S. and NATO-backed Ukrainian forces, CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said: ""I dont think we should underestimate Putins adherence to his original agenda, which was to control Ukraine. I dont think weve seen any reason to believe he has moved off that."" Nor should the U.S. underestimate Putins ""risk appetite,"" Cohen said. Putin and his officials early in the war made allusions to Russias nuclear arsenal and to massive retaliation in warning NATO not to get involved in the conflict. ""That being said, we have not seen concrete evidence of planning for the use of WMD,'' Cohen said. The more likely form of any Russian retaliation against the United States would be more attempts at interfering with the U.S. political system, other security and intelligence officials said.

The news came after days of apparent advances by Ukraine south of Kharkiv, the countrys second-largest city, in what could become the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize the capital of Kyiv at the start of the nearly seven-month war. Advertisement Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Saturday that troops would be regrouped from the Balakliya and Izyum areas to Ukraines tern Donetsk region. Izyum was a major base for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region and earlier this week social media videos showed residents of Balakliya joyfully cheering as Ukrainian troops moved in.

Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP Konashenkov said the Russian move is being made ""in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,"" one of the eastern Ukraine regions that Russia has declared sovereign. The claim of pullback to concentrate on Donetsk is similar to the justification Russia gave for pulling back its forces from the Kyiv region earlier this year when they failed to take the Ukrainian capital. Advertisement Ukrainian officials earlier Saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kharkiv region, saying Ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to Izyum. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko also suggested the Ukrainian troops had retaken Kupiansk, a town along the main supply route to Izyum, long a focus on the Russian front line and the site of heavy artillery and other fighting. Nikolenko tweeted a photo showing soldiers in front of what he said was a government building in Kupiansk, 73 kilometers (45 miles) north of Izyum.

""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,"" the British military said, adding that the loss of Kupiansk would greatly affect Russian supply lines. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, likewise referenced sweeping Ukrainian gains, estimating that Kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) in its eastern breakthrough. The institute said it appeared that ""disorganized Russian forces (were) caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance.""

The Ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming Saturday to have taken ""more than 1,000 square kilometers"" (386 square miles) from pro-Kremlin forces this week. It said ""in some areas, units of the Defense Forces have penetrated the enemys defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,"" matching the British assessment, but did not disclose geographical details. Advertisement Officials in Kyiv have for weeks been tight-lipped about plans for a counteroffensive to retake territory overrun by Russia early in the war, urging residents to refrain from sharing information on social media. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Ukrainian troops had reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive. ""We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people,"" Zelenskyy said. He spoke after the Ukrainian governor of Kharkiv reported that the national flag had been raised over Balakliya, a town recaptured by Ukrainian troops on Thursday following six months of Russian occupation. ""Balakliya is Ukraine! Today, together with the military, led by the commander of the Ground Forces Oleksandr Syrskyy, we raised the Ukrainian flag,"" governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. Advertisement Elsewhere, Ukrainian emergency services reported that a 62-year-old woman was killed in a Russian missile strike in the Kharkiv region when her home was flattened overnight. Syniehubov also accused Moscow of pummeling settlements retaken by Kyiv. He said in a Telegram post that five civilians were hospitalized in the Izyum district, while nine others suffered injuries elsewhere in the region. In the embattled Donbas region south of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian governor said civilians were killed and wounded overnight by Russian shelling near the city of Bakhmut, a key target of the stalled Russian offensive there. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that two people died and two more suffered injuries in Bakhmut and the neighboring village of Yahidne. Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Saturday, saying that Europe would not tire of helping Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putins efforts to raise the pressure by withholding energy supplies from European Union nations. Baerbock said Germany will assist Ukraine in finding and removing mines and other unexploded ordnance left by Russian troops in areas where they have been pushed back by Ukrainian forces.

['Matthew Lee'],World Opinion Shifts Against Russia As Ukraine Worries Grow,2022-09-23 15:54:51,"The tide of international opinion appears to have decisively shifted against Russia, as a number of non-aligned countries joined the United States and its allies in condemning Russias war in Ukraine and its threats to the principles of the international rules-based order.","NEW YORK (AP) -- The tide of international opinion appears to be decisively shifting against Russia, as a number of non-aligned countries are joining the United States and its allies in condemning Moscows war in Ukraine and its threats to the principles of the international rules-based order. Western officials have repeatedly said that Russia has become isolated since invading Ukraine in February. Until recently, though, that was largely wishful thinking. But on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, much of the international community spoke out against the conflict in a rare display of unity at the often fractured United Nations. Advertisement The tide had already appeared to be turning against Russian President Vladimir Putin even before Thursdays U.N. speeches. Chinese and Indian leaders had been critical of the war at a high-level summit last week in Uzbekistan. And then the U.N. General Assembly disregarded Russias objections and voted overwhelmingly to allow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be the only leader to address the body remotely, instead of requiring him to appear in person. That shift against Russia accelerated after Putin on Wednesday announced the mobilization of some additional 300,000 troops to Ukraine, signaling the unlikelihood of a quick end to the war. Putin also suggested that nuclear weapons may be an option. That followed an announcement of Russias intention to hold referendums in several occupied Ukrainian regions on whether they will become part of Russia. Those announcements came at the very moment that the General Assembly, considered the premier event in the global diplomatic calendar, was taking place in New York. Numerous world leaders used their speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday to denounce Russias war. That trend continued Thursday both in the assembly hall and at the usually deeply divided U.N. Security Council, where, one-by-one, virtually all of the 15 council members served up harsh criticism of Russia - a council member -- for aggravating several already severe global crises and imperiling the foundations of the world body. Advertisement The apparent shift in opinion offers some hope to Ukraine and its Western allies that increasing isolation will add pressure on Putin to negotiate a peace. But few are unduly optimistic. Putin has staked his legacy on the Ukraine war and few expect him to back down. And, Russia is hardly isolated. Many of its allies depend on it for energy, food and military assistance and are likely to stand by Putin regardless of what happens in Ukraine. Still, it was striking to hear Russias nominal friends like China and India, following up on last weeks remarks, speak of grave concerns they have about the conflict and its impact on global food and energy shortages as well as threats to the concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Brazil registered similar concerns. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa make up the so-called BRICS bloc of countries, which has often shunned or outright opposed Western initiatives and views on international relations. Only one country, Belarus, a non-council member and Russia ally that was invited to participate, spoke in support of Russia, but also called for a quick end to the fighting, which it called a ""tragedy."" ""We hear a lot about the divisions among countries at the United Nations,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. ""But recently, whats striking is the remarkable unity among member states when it comes to Russias war on Ukraine. Leaders from countries developing and developed, big and small, North and South have spoken in the General Assembly about the consequences of the war and the need to end it."" Advertisement ""Even a number of nations that maintain close ties with Moscow have said publicly that they have serious questions and concerns about President Putins ongoing invasion,"" Blinken said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was careful not to condemn the war but said that Chinas firm stance is that ""the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected. The purposes of the principles of the U.N. Charter should be observed."" Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said ""the trajectory of the Ukraine conflict is a matter of a profound concern for the international community."" He called for accountability for atrocities and abuses committed in Ukraine. ""If egregious attacks committed in broad daylight are left unpunished, this council must reflect on the signals we are sending on impunity. There must be consistency if we are to ensure credibility,"" he said. And Brazilian Foreign Minister Carlos Alberto Franca said immediate efforts to end the war are critical. ""The continuation of the hostilities endangers the lives of innocent civilians and jeopardizes the food and energy security of millions of families in other regions, especially in developing countries,"" he said. ""The risks of escalation arising for the current dynamics of the conflict are simply too great, and its consequences for the world order unpredictable."" Foreign ministers and top officials from Albania, Britain, France, Ireland, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico and Norway delivered similar rebukes. Advertisement ""Russias actions are blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations,"" said Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka. ""We all tried to prevent this conflict. We could not, but we must not fail to hold Russia accountable."" Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard called the invasion a ""flagrant breach of international law"" and Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said: ""If we fail to hold Russia accountable we send a message to large countries that they can prey on their neighbors with impunity."" Unsurprisingly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was unapologetic and defensive at the same time and specifically targeted Zelenskyy. Citing a phrase often attributed to President Franklin Roosevelt, Lavrov called Zelenskyy ""a bastard,"" but said Western leaders regarded him as ""our bastard."" He repeated a long list of Russias complaints about Ukraine and accused Western countries of using Ukraine for anti-Russia activities and policies. ""Everything Ive said today simply confirms that the decision to conduct the special military operation was inevitable,"" Lavrov said, following Russian practice of not calling the invasion a war. Advertisement Russia has denied being isolated and the foreign ministry used social media to publicize a number of apparently cordial meetings that Lavrov has held with foreign minister colleagues at the UN in recent days. Still, Blinken and his colleagues from other NATO nations seized on what they believe to be growing opposition to and impatience with Putin. And, several speakers, including Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, pointed out that Lavrov skipped the meeting except for his speaking slot. ""I notice that Russian diplomats flee almost as quickly as Russian soldiers,"" Kuleba said, referring to Lavrovs hasty exit along with recent Russian troop retreats in Ukraine. ___",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-un-general-assembly-russia-isolation_n_632dd3a9e4b00f7fcb522fe2

But the voting has been anything but free or fair.,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Referendums that are expected to serve as a pretext for Moscow to annex Russian-held regions of Ukraine reached their final day of voting Tuesday as the preordained outcome of the Kremlin-orchestrated votes heightened tension between Russia and the West. The annexation of the four occupied regions in southern and eastern Ukraine, which could happen as soon as Friday, sets the stage for a dangerous new phase in the seven-month war in Ukraine. Advertisement Russia warned it could resort to deploying nuclear weapons to defend its own territory, including newly acquired lands. After the balloting, ""the situation will radically change from the legal viewpoint, from the point of view of international law, with all the corresponding consequences for protection of those areas and ensuring their security,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday. The referendums ask residents of the regions in southern and eastern Ukraine whether they want the areas to become part of Russia. But the voting has been anything but free or fair. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin has talked up Moscows nuclear option since last week following a Ukrainian counteroffensive that led to recent battlefield setbacks and has the Kremlins forces increasingly cornered. Advertisement The balloting that started Friday in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk regions and a call-up of Russian military reservists ordered by Putin are other strategies aimed at buttressing Moscows exposed position. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the Russian Security Council chaired by Putin, spelled out the threat in the bluntest terms yet Tuesday. ""Lets imagine that Russia is forced to use the most powerful weapon against the Ukrainian regime that has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state,"" Medvedev wrote on his messaging app channel. ""I believe that NATO will steer clear from direct meddling in the conflict in that case."" The United States has dismissed the Kremlins nuclear talk as scare tactics. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, responded to Putins nuclear threats from last week. Sullivan told NBC on Sunday that Russia would pay a high, if unspecified, price if Moscow made good on threats to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.

But the voting has been anything but free or fair. Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the regions amid the war, and images shared by those who remained showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting. Western allies are standing firm with Ukraine, dismissing the referendum votes as a sham. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said while visiting Kyiv on Tuesday that France was determined ""to support Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Meanwhile, the mass call-up of Russians to active military duty has to some degree backfired on Putin. It has triggered a massive exodus of men from the country, fueled protests in many regions across Russia and sparked occasional acts of violence. On Monday, a gunman opened fire in an enlistment office in a Siberian city and gravely wounded the local chief military recruitment officer. The shooting came after scattered arson attacks on enlistment offices. Advertisement With Putins back against the wall amid Ukraines battlefield successes, Russian media speculated he might follow up on last weeks partial mobilization order by declaring martial law and shutting the nations borders for all men of fighting age. Russian officials announced plans to set up a military recruitment office right on the border with Georgia, one of the main routes of the exodus. As Moscow works to build up its troops in Ukraine, Russian shelling continued to claim lives. At least 11 civilians were killed and 18 others wounded by Russian barrages in 24 hours, Ukraines presidential office said Tuesday. Among the casualties were eight people, including a 15-year-old boy, who were killed by a Russian strike on the town of Pervomaiskyi in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern Donetsk region where shells killed three people, said that ""every day of the referendum we count more dead in the Donbas, and those sad numbers show Russias real goals."" Advertisement Donetsk and Luhansk, which Moscow-backed separatists have partly controlled for eight years, together make up Ukraines industrial Donbas region. The Ukraine war is still gripping world attention, as it causes widespread shortages and rising prices not only for food but for energy, inflation hitting the cost of living everywhere, and growing global inequality. The talk of nuclear war has only deepened the concern. Misery and hardship are often the legacy of Russias occupation of Ukrainian areas now recaptured by Kyivs forces. Some people have had no gas, electricity, running water or internet since March. The war has brought an energy crunch for much of Western Europe, with German officials seeing the disruption of Russian supplies as a power play by the Kremlin to pressure Europe over its support for Ukraine. The German economy ministry said Tuesday that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline leading from Russia to Europe has reported a drop in pressure, only hours after a leak was reported in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea off Denmark. Both pipelines were built to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe.

The burial site, containing hundreds of graves, was discovered close to Izium after a rapid counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces liberated the northeastern city and other swaths of the Kharkiv region, breaking what was largely becoming a military stalemate in the nearly seven-month war. Advertisement To keep the offensive going, the Biden administration announced another $600 million package of military aid Thursday for Ukraine, including more of the weaponry that has helped its troops seize momentum. Associated Press journalists who visited the burial site Thursday counted hundreds of graves amid the trees, marked with simple wooden crosses -- most of them numbered, up to 400 and beyond. There was also at least one mass grave, with a marker saying it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. In his nightly televised address on Thursday, Zelenskyy said ""more information -- clear, verifiable information"" about the burial site is expected Friday.

Others died from artillery fire, mines or airstrikes. Many of the bodies have not been identified yet, Bolvinov said. Russian forces left Izium and other parts of the Kharkiv region last week amid the stunningly rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy made a rare trip outside the capital to watch the national flag being raised over Iziums city hall.

(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File) via AP KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Russia attacked power stations and other infrastructure Sunday, causing widespread outages across Ukraine as Kyivs forces pressed a swift counteroffensive that has driven Moscows troops from swaths of territory it had occupied in the northeast. The bombardment ignited a massive fire at a power station on Kharkivs western outskirts and killed at least one person. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the ""deliberate and cynical missile strikes"" against civilian targets as acts of terrorism. Advertisement Ukraines second-largest city of Kharkiv appeared to be without power Sunday night. Cars drove through darkened streets, and the few pedestrians used flashlights or mobile phones to light their way. Separately, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the Russia-occupied south completely shut down in a bid to prevent a radiation disaster as fighting raged nearby. Kyivs action in recent days to reclaim Russia-occupied areas in the Kharkiv region forced Moscow to withdraw its troops to prevent them from being surrounded, leaving behind significant numbers of weapons and munitions in a hasty flight as the war marked its 200th day on Sunday. Ukraines military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyy, said its forces had recaptured about 3,000 square kilometers (1,160 square miles) since the counteroffensive began in early September. He said Ukrainian troops are only 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the Russian border. Advertisement One battalion shared a video of Ukrainian forces in front of a municipal building in Hoptivka, a village just over a mile from the border and about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kharkiv. Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Ukrainian troops have reclaimed control of more than 40 settlements in the region. In Sunday nights missile attacks by Russia, the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions seemed to bear the brunt. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Sumy had only partially lost power, Zelenskyy said. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov called the power outage ""revenge by the Russian aggressor for the successes of our army at the front, in particular, in the Kharkiv region."" Ukrainian officials said Russia hit Kharkiv TEC-5, the countrys second-biggest heat and power plant, and Zelenskyy posted video of the Kharkiv power plant on fire.

Addressing Russia, he added: ""Do you still think you can intimidate, break us, force us to make concessions? ... Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst for us are not as scary and deadly as your `friendship and brotherhood. But history will put everything in place. And we will be with gas, lights, water and food ... and WITHOUT you!"" Later in the evening some power had been restored in some regions. None of the outages were believed to be related to the shutdown of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant. While most attention focused on the counteroffensive, Ukraines nuclear energy operator said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europes largest, was reconnected to Ukraines electricity grid, allowing engineers to shut down its last operational reactor to safeguard it amid the fighting. The plant, one of the 10 biggest atomic power stations in the world, has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the war. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for shelling around it. Advertisement Since a Sept. 5 fire caused by shelling knocked the plant off transmission lines, the reactor was powering crucial safety equipment in so-called ""island mode"" -- an unreliable regime that left the plant increasingly vulnerable to a potential nuclear accident.

But IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he is ""gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues."" He said talks have begun on establishing a safety and security zone around it. In a call Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the withdrawal of Russian troops and weaponry from the plant in line with IAEA recommendations. The pullback of Moscows forces in recent days marked the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize Kyiv near the start of the war. The Kharkiv campaign seemed to take Moscow by surprise; it had relocated many of its troops from the region to the south in expectation of a counteroffensive there. Advertisement Yuriy Kochevenko, of the 95th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, tweeted a video from what appeared to be central Izyum. The city was considered an important command and supply hub for Russias northern front. ""Everything around is destroyed, but we will restore everything. Izyum was, is, and will be Ukraine,"" Kochevenko said in his video, showing the empty central square and destroyed buildings. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff said Russian troops also had left several settlements in the Kherson region, in the southern part of the country, as Kyivs forces pressed the counteroffensive. It did not identify the areas. But an official with the Russian-backed administration in the city of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, said on social media that the city north of the Crimean Peninsula was safe and asked everyone to stay calm. The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday the withdrawal from Izyum and other areas was intended to strengthen Moscows forces in the neighboring Donetsk region to the south. The explanation was similar to how Russia justified pulling back from Kyiv earlier this year. Advertisement But Igor Strelkov, who led Russia-backed forces when the separatist conflict in the Donbas erupted in 2014, mocked the Russian Defense Ministrys explanation of the retreat, suggesting that handing over Russias own territory near the border was a ""contribution to a Ukrainian settlement."" The retreat angered Russian military bloggers and nationalist commentators, who bemoaned it as a major defeat and urged the Kremlin to step up its war efforts. Many criticized Russian authorities for continuing with fireworks and other lavish festivities in Moscow that marked a city holiday on Saturday despite the debacle in Ukraine. In Moscow, Putin attended the opening of a huge Ferris wheel in a park on Saturday, and inaugurated a new transport link and a sports arena. The action underscored the Kremlins narrative that the war it calls a ""special military operation"" was going according to plan without affecting Russians everyday lives. Pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov criticized the Moscow festivities as a grave mistake. ""The fireworks in Moscow on a tragic day of Russias military defeat will have extremely serious political consequences,"" Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. ""Authorities mustnt celebrate when people are mourning."" In a sign of a potential rift in the Russian leadership, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, said the retreat resulted from blunders by the Russian brass.

""If they dont make changes in the strategy of conducting the special military operation in the next day or two, I will be forced to contact the leadership of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO cautioned Friday the war would likely go on for months, urging the West to keep supporting Ukraine through what could be a difficult winter.

The second incident in a week in Crimea raised increasing questions about whether Ukrainian forces managed to hit the peninsula. Videos posted on social media showed thick plumes of smoke rising over the raging flames, and a series of multiple explosions could be heard in the background.

The blaze and blasts rattled the village of Mayskoye in the Dzhankoi district of Crimea early Tuesday, Russian media also reported. Another morning incident was reported in Dzhankoi itself -- according to Russias state news agency RIA Novosti, a transformer substation was on fire after ""a loud thump sound."" Russias Energy Ministry reported shortly after that the fire at the substation was contained. Advertisement It wasnt immediately clear whether the fire at the substation and the fire at the ammunition storage site were connected. Kyiv certainly reinforced a message of chaos. ""Morning near Dzhankoi began with explosions. A reminder: Crimea of normal country is about the Black Sea, mountains, recreation and tourism,"" Podolyak wrote, referring to the time before Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014. The Russian Defense Ministry said a fire erupted at a ""site for temporary storage of ammunition of one of the military units."" ""As a result of the fire, the stored ammunition detonated,"" the ministry said, adding that it wasnt immediately clear what caused the fire. The Dzhankoi district of Crimea is in the north of the peninsula, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russian-controlled region of Kherson in southern Ukraine. Kyiv has recently mounted a series of attacks on various sites in the region, targeting supply routes for the Russian military there and ammunition depots. Advertisement Crimeas Russian-appointed governor Sergei Aksyonov said that two people sustained injuries in the most recent incident, and that local residents were being evacuated from the area, as explosions of ammunition continued. Aksyonov said some residential buildings were damaged near the site of the fire, and about 2,000 people were evacuated from nearby areas. According to Russian media, railway lines going through Mayskoye were also damaged. Aksyonov said all trains will be stopped at the town of Vladislavovka, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Mayskoye, and passengers will be able to continue their journeys on buses. Last week, a series of explosions occurred at the Saki air base near the Novofyodorovka village in Crimea. The Russian military blamed the blasts on an accidental detonation of munitions there, but the incident appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack. Kyiv said the explosions destroyed nine Russian airplanes.

The Crimean Peninsula holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for both sides. The Kremlins demand that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories.

The United States' top diplomat and the head of NATO noted the advances, but cautioned that the war is likely to drag on for months. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy commended the military for its gains in the east, saying in a nightly video address that Ukrainian troops have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive there this week. Advertisement ""We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people."" Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's military said it also launched new attacks on Russian pontoon bridges used to bring supplies across the Dnieper River to Kherson, one of the largest Russian-occupied cities, and the adjacent region. Ukrainian artillery and rocket strikes have left all regular bridges across the river unusable, the military's southern command said. Anxiety increased about Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which was operating in emergency mode Friday for the fifth straight day due to the war. That prompted the head of the U.N. atomic watchdog to call for the establishment of an immediate safety zone around the plant to prevent a nuclear accident. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant came under the control of Russian forces early in the war but is being operated by Ukrainian staff. The plant and surrounding areas have been repeatedly hit by shelling that Russia and Ukraine blame on each other. The last power line connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity grid was cut Monday, leaving the plant without an outside source of electricity. It is receiving power for its own safety systems from the only reactor -- out of six total -- that remains operational. Advertisement In other advances, the Ukrainian military said it took control of the village of Volokhiv Yar in the Kharkiv region and aimed to advance toward strategically valuable town of Kupiansk, which would cut off Russian forces from key supply routes. Pro-Russian authorities in the Kupiansk district announced that civilians were being evacuated toward the Russian-held region of Luhansk. ""The initial signs are positive and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels, a day after visiting Kyiv. ""But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time,"" he said. ""There are a huge number of Russian forces in Ukraine and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President (Vladimir) Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this at huge cost to Russia."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met with Blinken, said the war is ""entering a critical phase."" Advertisement The gains ""are modest and only the first successes of the counteroffensive of the Ukrainian army, but they are important both in terms of seizing the military initiative and raising the spirit of Ukrainian soldiers,"" Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military analyst at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told The Associated Press. Energoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear operator, said Friday that repairs to outside electric lines at the Zaporizhzhia plant are impossible because of the shelling and that operating the plant in what is called an ""island"" status carries ""the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards."" ""Only the withdrawal of the Russians from the plant and the creation of a security zone around it can normalize the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Only then will the world be able to exhale,"" Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian TV. Earlier, Kotin told The Associated Press the plant's only operating reactor ""can be stopped completely"" at any moment and as a consequence, the only power source would be a diesel generator. There are 20 generators on site and enough diesel fuel for 10 days. After that, about 200 tons of diesel fuel would be needed daily for the generators, which he said is ""impossible"" to get while the plant is occupied by Russian forces. Advertisement Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Friday that there was little likelihood of reestablishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant. ""This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,"" Grossi said, calling for an ""immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area"" and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. ""This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,"" he said. Fighting continued Friday elsewhere in Ukraine. Russian planes bombed the hospital in the town of Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, said Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of the Sumy region. He said the building was destroyed and there were an unknown number of casualties. In the Donetsk region in the east -- one of two that Russia declared to be sovereign states at the outset of the war -- eight people were killed in the city of Bakhmut over the past day and the city is without water and electricity for the fourth straight day, said governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. Four people were killed in shelling in the Kharkiv region, two of them in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, according to governor Oleh Syniehubov. The shelling of the city continued Friday afternoon, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, wounding 10 people, including three children. Advertisement Ukraine this week claimed to have regained control of more than 20 settlements in the Kharkiv region, including the small city of Balakliya. Social media posts showed weeping, smiling Balakliya residents embracing Ukrainian soldiers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday refused to comment on the alleged retaking of Balakliya, redirecting all such questions to the Russian Defense Ministry. But Vitaly Ganchev, the Russian-installed official in the Kharkiv region, confirmed Friday that ""Balakliya, in effect, is not under our control."" Ganchev said ""tough battles"" were continuing in the city. Helicopters and fighter jets streaked over the rolling plains of the Donetsk region, with the jets heading toward Izium, near where Ukrainian forces have been carrying out a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. The jets fired flares and black smoke billowed in the distance. -- Associated Press writer Elena Becatoros in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report.

A wave of missiles, rockets and drones has struck dozens of locations across Ukraine since Monday, according to officials, targeting civilian infrastructure in several major cities, including Kyiv, located hundreds of miles from the front lines in the east and south. The wide bombardment echoed the early days of Russias scattershot initial invasion in February, but also underlined that the conflict in Ukraine, which for months appeared to be descending into a slow and painful grind in the Donbas, has erupted once again as winter nears. Not for the first time, the war is teetering toward an unpredictable new phase. ""This is now the third, fourth, possibly fifth different war that weve been observing,"" said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham Houses Russia and Eurasia Programme. The strikes followed weeks of Ukrainian ground gains and began two days after a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge, the only crossing between the annexed Crimean peninsula and Russia. That blast, which was used by the Kremlin as a justification for Mondays onslaught, bruised the Russian psyche and handed Ukraine a significant strategic boost. With the cold months nearing and likely bringing a slowdown in ground combat, experts say the next weeks of the war are now expected to be vital, and another potential spike in intensity looms over Ukraine as each side seeks to strike another blow.

So far roughly 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine, with Musk tweeting on Friday the ""operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year."" But those charitable contributions could be coming to an end, as SpaceX has warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month. Documents obtained by CNN show that last month Musks SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraines government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. ""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" SpaceXs director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter. Among the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian militarys commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals. In a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, ""SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy."" The documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceXs own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv. Musk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musks Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: ""F*** off."" Ukraines ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musks claimed peace plan for Russias Ukraine war by saying: ""F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk."" ""Were just following his recommendation,"" Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNNs reporting and Melnyks comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange. Reports of outages The letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Sources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. ""That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,"" said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. ""Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate."" This photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images There was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on. The Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a ""catastrophic"" loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didnt dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified. SpaceXs suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musks allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he ""still very much support[s] Ukraine"" but fears ""massive escalation."" Musk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesnt want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, ""Russia would accept those terms,"" according to a person who heard them. ""Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,"" the person familiar with the discussions said. ""The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. Thats Elon Musk. He hasnt been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built."" On Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraines infrastructure, Musk replied: ""Youre most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine."" ""The gall to look like heroes"" More than seven months into the war, its hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. Its not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire. CNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases. Elon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images ""Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,"" said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. ""Without that theyd be really operating in the blind in many cases."" Though Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon. SpaceXs request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has ""the gall to look like heroes"" while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month. According to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid - or partially paid - for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.) In his July letter to Musk, Ukraines commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units ""exceptional utility"" and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses. SpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense. On September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraines new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022. Those costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year. SpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, ""The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraines armed forces as they repel Russias brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time."" Breaking down the costs Early US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals. US Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images The US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding. The far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level - $4,500 a month - to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service. The terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlinks website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month. Thats just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying. ""You could say hes trying to get money from the government or just trying to say 'I dont want to be part of this anymore,"" said the person familiar with Ukraines requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musks reputation for being unpredictable, ""Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,"" this person said. Musk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.

The announcement by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin came shortly after the head of the Moscow-backed administration in Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, appealed to the Kremlin for help moving residents out of harms way, in the latest indication that Russian forces were struggling in the face of Ukrainian advances. The Ukrainian military has been carrying out a counteroffensive in Kherson and eastern parts of the country, taking back territory that had been occupied by Russia as well as striking critical infrastructure such as bridges and railways. Saldo claimed cities throughout Kherson, one of four Ukrainian regions Russia claimed to have annexed in violation of international law, were being hammered by dangerous airstrikes. Ukrianin forces are seen taking control of a village on Friday in the Kherson region. Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Saldo said local Russian leadership had ""decided to organize the possibility of Kherson families traveling to other regions of the Russian Federation."" ""We suggested that all residents of the Kherson region, if there is such a wish, to protect themselves from the consequences of missile strikes, should go to other regions ... to take their children and leave."" Fighting in Kherson has intensified in recent weeks, as Kyiv pushes ahead with its goal to take back parts of the region Russia seized in the early days of the invasion. US and Ukrainian officials said last month that they hoped to retake all of Kherson by the end of the year. As of last week, Ukraine said it had recaptured 2,400 square kilometers (927 square miles) in Kherson previously under Russian control. Authorities in Kyiv said Wednesday that it had liberated five more small, rural villages as the Ukrainian military pushes further southwest. With Ukrainian forces barreling forward, Saldo appealed to Russian leaders to help local Russian-backed officials move civilians. ""We, residents of the Kherson region, of course, know that Russia does not abandon its own people,"" Saldo said. However, Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Kherson regions military administration, said that the civilian transports were not an ""evacuation."" ""There is no evacuation in the Kherson region and there cannot be any,"" he said. Stremousov has been openly critical of the wars decision-makers in Moscow and on the battlefield. Last week, he blamed the military setbacks in Kherson on ""incompetent commanders"" who have not been held accountable for their mistakes. On Thursday, Stremousov insisted that Saldo was only requesting that authorities ""help organize the departure of residents of the Kherson region for temporary stay and rest in other regions of the Russian Federation."" ""We urge the residents of the Kherson region to remain calm and to not panic. Nobody is going to withdraw Russian troops from the Kherson region,"" Stremousov said.

(Rebecca Wright/CNN) As air raid sirens blared in the small Ukrainian city of Uman, about 125 miles south of the capital Kyiv, families crowded into a makeshift bomb shelter underneath a central synagogue. Before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last week, the basement of the temple was used as a bathhouse for Jewish worshippers to do their ritual washing -- or mivkeh -- before prayers. But now, the Synagogue of the Breslover Hasidim is opening its doors to all locals looking for shelter from the threat of Russian troops. Uman was hit by missile attacks on the first day of the invasion, but has not seen any major fighting yet. Still, the city is on edge, and remaining residents are preparing for the worst. ""We invite all the people, all Ukrainians, all Hasidic people, doesnt matter who,"" said Irina Rybnitskaya, a lawyer for the US-owned foundation that runs the synagogue. ""We prepare this place especially for them, in order to hide (when) there is (an) alarm."" The temporary hideout is lined with wooden benches and has been stocked with mattresses, blankets and hot drinks. The residents have arrived carrying their valuables and bags of clothing, in case they have to camp out for days -- or longer -- in the shelter. ""Its safe to be here, thats why I am here,"" said Dasha Borscht, 16, a non-Jewish resident taking refuge in the basement. The Jewish neighborhood in Uman is normally busy with visitors to the tomb of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement who died in 1810. Every year in September, the streets turn into a festival scene, with tens of thousands of Jewish pilgrims descending on the memorial complex to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. But since Uman came under attack on the first day of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, many residents have fled. Its shops have been left shuttered and streets strewn with litter. Roadblocks run by Ukrainian soldiers now guard the perimeter of the city, with strict document checks for every vehicle passing through. The Jewish community in the city has dwindled from around 600 members to under less than 60 since the Russian invasion began, according to the synagogues lawyer. ""All the people is afraid to be here,"" said Yehuda Turgiman, a worshipper at the synagogue. ""Stop with the war, stop with the fighting, stop with the hate."" Those left behind are those who cant -- or wont -- leave their homes, along with some who stay out of religious conviction. ""I didnt go to Bulgaria, because I believe Rabbi Nachman cares about us, and nobody can do something that God doesnt want,"" said Shula, a worshipper at the synagogue who was born in Israel but has lived in Uman for 21 years. ""Putin will not come here, and the soldiers will not come here."" Other residents have decided to stay in Uman to fight back against the Russians. Tzvi Arieli, a former soldier with the Israel Defense Forces who has lived in Ukraine for a decade, told CNN that he is helping to train civilians to use weapons and learn basic combat first aid. He said most of them are businessmen, and they have never held a weapon before. A week ago, taking up arms was unthinkable to most people here. ""We dont have weapons, we dont want to fight,"" Turgiman said. The threat to Uman and its holy tomb was brought into focus on Tuesday, when a Russian attack on a Kyiv TV tower struck in the vicinity of Babyn Yar shrine -- a site of mourning for more than 30,000 Jew massacred there by Nazi killing squads in 1941, one of the worst mass murders of Jews during the Holocaust.

Victoria Spartz, the first Ukrainian-born member of Congress speaks with other members prior to the start of President Joe Bidens State of the Union address on March 1. (J. Scott Applewhite/Pool/AP/Getty Images) Rep. Victoria Spartz, the first Ukrainian-born member of Congress, is urging the State Department to send its diplomats back into Ukraine. Spartz, a Republican from Indiana, sent a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday saying that the US should consider redeploying US diplomats to Lviv in Western Ukraine to provide better coordination with Ukraine. Spartz pointed to the actions of the European Union, which returned its diplomatic corps to Kyiv. ""As the single largest provider of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, it is past time that the United States follow our European allies in kind,"" Spartz wrote. The US and other countries pulled their diplomats and evacuated embassies and consulates from Kyiv in the days leading up to Russias invasion of Ukraine, shifting them to the western city of Lviv. Those officials were soon moved to Poland, commuting into Lviv, and the State Department suspended all diplomatic services in Lviv just before Russias invasion began. In recent days, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged more countries to restore their diplomatic presence in the country. ""We need your support, even at the level of symbols and diplomatic gestures. Please come back, everybody who is brave, please come back to our capital and continue working,"" Zelensky said last week. But given the ongoing fighting and the concerns about renewed Russian aggressions in Eastern Ukraine the Biden administration is not making moves to open their embassy in Ukraine in the near term despite other countries beginning to do so, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. What other lawmakers are saying: Spartzs letter marks a public push for the US to reconsider that position. One Democratic lawmaker who supports re-establishing a diplomatic presence in Ukraine said there have been questions from the region about why the Americans arent there as other countries have gone back in. Another Democrat, however, said the State Department has good reason to be cautious about moving Americans back onto Ukraine soil. While Russia has refocused its war efforts into the east and southern regions of the country, Russias air power can still strike Kyiv and Lviv. While any civilian deaths from NATO countries in Ukraine could threaten to escalate the conflict with Russia, there are significantly different implications for the United States, the lawmaker said: ""Its a very different security situation and escalatory posture."" Ukrainian officials and activists are watching other countries move to reopen their embassies and they are frustrated by the tentative US posture. The European Union announced last week that it would resume its diplomatic presence in the Ukrainian capital. Daria Kaleniuk, the co-founder and executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, are also urging the US to re-open its embassy ""urgently."" Kaleniuk believes that the embassy is symbolically significant but it is also important because it enables congressional visits and incoming shipments to occur more easily. ""What I learned that part of the reason why politicians are not coming because there is no embassy. So the embassy cannot provide them support in coming,"" Kaleniuk said after spending last week on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers. ""The lack of -- an American Embassy in Ukraine also has negative impact on the possibility to purchase advanced weapons. Contractors who are building these advanced weapons, they see that there is not even an embassy in Ukraine and they are not able to work on the contracts with Ukraine."" Meanwhile, US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that Congress may need to approve additional funds for military and humanitarian support to Ukraine in its war with Russia, signaling early backing for more aid that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has also said will be needed. ""At the rate were shipping them weapons and ammunition, we may need to do another supplemental"" spending bill to continue to arm the Ukrainians and ""backfill"" weapons to other NATO countries that have sent their stockpiles to Ukraine,"" McConnell said at an appearance at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce in Louisville. Congress approved about $14 billion in aid to Ukraine just last month. McConnell said the Ukrainians can win the war if properly supported. ""My attitude about this from the very beginning is that our goal ought to be to win. To win. And I think the administration has been reluctant to say the goal is to win,"" he said. ""I think our definition of winning is whatever Zelensky says it is. In other words, as long as they want to fight, we ought to give them everything we possibly can to win the fight.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-12-22/index.html
[],Latest Ukraine-Russia War News: Live Updates,,"Russias barrage of missile attacks this week has not changed the course of the ground war, though its forces are on the offensive in one area of the east.","Image Smoke over Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Monday after Russian missile strikes. Credit... Finbarr OReilly for The New York Times KYIV, Ukraine -- They exploded with dull thuds on the outskirts of towns and detonated in the center of cities with deafening booms. Strikes in Kyiv, the capital, left cars burning and splatters of blood on the sidewalks. Through the week, the Russian military fired its most intense barrage of missiles at Ukraine since the start of the war in February, killing at least three dozen civilians, knocking out electricity across swaths of the country and overwhelming air defenses. One thing the missiles didnt do was change the course of the ground war. Fought mostly in trenches, with the most fierce combat now in an area of rolling hills and pine forests in the east and on the open plains in the south, these battles are where control of territory is decided -- and where Russias military continued to lose ground this week, despite the missile strikes. ""They use their expensive rockets for nothing, just to frighten people,"" Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament with Ukraines European Solidarity party, said of the paltry military effect of the Russian cruise missiles, rockets and self-destructing drones used in the strikes. ""They think they can scare Ukrainians. But the goal they achieved is only making us angrier."" The war in the south and east continued apace through the strikes, with Russia mostly falling back but also attacking on one section of front in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. On Monday and Tuesday, the most intense days of Russias missile strikes, the Ukrainian Army continued its offensive in the Kherson region in the south, reclaiming five villages over the two days, according to the military command. Ukrainian forces also took back a village in the east. ""The Kremlin continues to struggle to message itself out of the reality of mobilization and military failures,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, wrote in an analysis published Thursday. ""The Kremlin continued its general pattern of temporarily appeasing the nationalist communities by conducting retaliatory missile strikes."" The war is now separated into two largely unconnected arenas: the battles in the sky, in which Russia is seeking to demoralize Ukrainian society and cripple the economy by using cruise missiles and drones to destroy heating, electricity and water infrastructure as winter sets in; and the battles on the ground, in which Ukraine continues to advance against Russian forces in two areas of the front line. Image Ukrainian soldiers dismantled an abandoned Russian vehicle for parts in Novomykolaivka, Ukraine, on Sunday. Novomykolaivka was retaken by Ukrainian troops last week. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times Russia has been using even the newest addition to its arsenal, Shahed-136 kamikaze drones purchased from Iran, principally for strategic strikes far from the front line, rather than in efforts to slow the Ukrainian attacks. ""Shahed-136s will not generate asymmetric effects for Russian forces because they are not being used to strike areas of critical military significance in a way that directly influences the frontline,"" the Institute for the Study of War wrote. The drones that get past air defenses instead buzz into cities, blowing up electrical power stations and municipal boilers used to heat neighborhoods in the centralized heating systems used in Ukraine. Over the past 24 hours, the Russian Army and air force attacked around the country with missiles, rockets and self-destructing drones, from the region around Kyiv, the capital, to Mykolaiv in the south, near the Black Sea, the Ukrainian General Staff said in its regular morning report. ""The enemy is not halting strikes on critical infrastructure and civilian objects,"" it said, listing 88 strikes, including with short-range rocket systems near the front line. The strikes have refocused Ukrainians attention on the war in cities where a sense of normalcy had been returning, including Kyiv, the capital. Even successful advances for the Ukrainian Army have been bloody and costly as the Russian military has been skirmishing and firing artillery to cover its retreat and continuing attacks in Donbas. Fighting raged along the entire front and in cross-border skirmishing with Russia in northern Ukraine overnight Thursday to Friday, the military command said in a morning statement.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/14/world/russia-ukraine-war-news

He gave that figure to the boards of governors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr. Zelensky said that $17 billion would be needed to rebuild schools, hospitals, transport systems and housing, with $2 billion going toward expanding exports to Europe and restoring Ukraines energy infrastructure. After the bombardment of Ukraine began on Monday, Mr. Putin said he had ordered it in retaliation for a truck-bombing that badly damaged the vital Kerch Strait Bridge connecting Russia to the occupied Crimea Peninsula. Moscow has tried to minimize the impact of the attack, but new satellite imagery suggests that it has, in fact, been substantial. The images captured hundreds of cargo trucks backed up and waiting to cross from Crimea into Russia by ferry, some five days after the bombing. The images, captured on Wednesday by Maxar Technologies, show a big backup at the port in Kerch and a line of trucks miles away at an airport that is apparently being used as a staging area. Oleg Ignatov, a senior Russia analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the long lines for the ferry crossing had been exacerbated by security checkpoints set up after the bridge explosion.

[],The Critical Moment Behind Ukraine's Rapid Advance,,President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to make a dramatic move in the war against Russia. U.S. and Ukrainian officials came up with a plan.,"American officials were hesitant to judge the full impact of the counteroffensive, anxious to see how it continues to play out. For now, Kyiv has the advantage. One critical moment this summer came during a war game with U.S. and Ukrainian officials aimed at testing the success of a broad offensive across the south. The exercise, reported earlier by CNN, suggested such an offensive would fail. Armed with the American skepticism, Ukrainian military officials went back to Mr. Zelensky. ""We did do some modeling and some tabletop exercises,"" Colin Kahl, the Pentagons policy chief, said in a telephone interview. ""That set of exercises suggested that certain avenues for a counteroffensive were likely to be more successful than others. We provided that advice, and then the Ukrainians internalized that and made their own decision."" The stakes were huge. Ukraine needed to demonstrate that this was not going to become just another frozen conflict, and that it could retake territory, for the morale of its people and to shore up support of the West. Throughout August, at the behest of Ukrainians, U.S. officials stepped up feeds of intelligence about the position of Russian forces, highlighting weaknesses in the Russian lines. The intelligence also indicated that Moscow would struggle to quickly reinforce its troops in northeast Ukraine or move troops from the south, even if it detected Ukrainian preparations for the counteroffensive. ""We saw the fact that the Russians actually relocated a lot of their best forces down to the south in preparation for the other counteroffensive that the Ukrainians kicked off,"" Mr. Kahl said. ""So we had reason to believe that because of the persistent morale challenges, and the pressure of the Ukrainians, that there might be pockets of the Russian military that are a little more brittle than they appear on paper.""

[],The Roots of the Ukraine War: How the Crisis Developed,,"Russias invasion of Ukraine is the biggest military mobilization in Europe since World War II. Heres a guide to how it came about, and whats at stake for Russia, the U.S. and NATO.","It felt like a scene from the Cold War, a perilous episode from a bygone era. An unpredictable Russian leader was amassing troops and tanks on a neighbors border. There was fear of a bloody East-West conflagration. Then the Cold War turned hot: Vladimir V. Putin ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine. The repercussions were immediate, and far-reaching. Now, following the launch of Russias full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, the largest mobilization of forces Europe has seen since 1945 is underway. So far, Moscow has been denied the swift victory it anticipated, and has failed to capture major cities across the country, including Kyiv, the capital. It has been weighed down by an ill-prepared military and has faced tenacious resistance from Ukrainian soldiers and civilian resistance fighters. Still, Russia has superior military might, and Mr. Putin has indicated that his ultimate goal is to capture Kyiv, topple Ukraines democratically elected government, and subsume the country into Russias orbit. The invasion threatens to destabilize the already volatile post-Soviet region, with serious consequences for the security structure that has governed Europe since the 1990s. Mr. Putin has long lamented the loss of Ukraine and other republics when the Soviet Union broke apart. Now, diminishing NATO, the military alliance that helped keep the Soviets in check, appears to be part of his mission. Before invading, Russia made a list of far-reaching demands to reshape that structure -- positions NATO and the United States rejected.",https://www.nytimes.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-europe.html
[],U.S. Believes Ukrainians Were Behind an Assassination in Russia,,American officials said they were not aware of the plan ahead of time for the attack that killed Daria Dugina and that they had admonished Ukraine over it.,"WASHINGTON -- United States intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorized the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, an element of a covert campaign that U.S. officials fear could widen the conflict. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, officials said. American officials also said they were not aware of the operation ahead of time and would have opposed the killing had they been consulted. Afterward, American officials admonished Ukrainian officials over the assassination, they said. The closely held assessment of Ukrainian complicity, which has not been previously reported, was shared within the U.S. government last week. Ukraine denied involvement in the killing immediately after the attack, and senior officials repeated those denials when asked about the American intelligence assessment. While Russia has not retaliated in a specific way for the assassination, the United States is concerned that such attacks -- while high in symbolic value -- have little direct impact on the battlefield and could provoke Moscow to carry out its own strikes against senior Ukrainian officials.

[],Ukraine Under Attack: Documenting the Russian Invasion,,Photographers in and around Ukraine have captured the horrors of war.,"Shattered towns, mass graves and suffering beyond measure greet the Ukrainian forces steadily pushing back Russian troops, revealing the civilian and military toll of the war and the invaders occupation in the east and south. The Ukrainian counteroffensive and Russian retreat are making a mockery of the Kremlins claims to have annexed four regions of Ukraine after sham referendums -- though Russias advantage in arms and its conscription of civilians could yet change that balance. The slow-moving war of summer, waged with long-range artillery that flattened whole towns, has given way to rapid Ukrainian advances. But for Kyivs forces, the elation at retaking territory seized by the Russians is tempered by the brutal cost, both in and out of their own ranks, and by the knowledge that a large part of Ukraine remains in Moscows hands. This, then, is what winning now looks like: ruined buildings, crumpled bridges, burned-out vehicles and depopulated places where the few residents who remain look haunted, many of them older, hungry, sick, cold. And everywhere, bodies -- dead soldiers and civilians, in hastily dug graves, in blasted cars or just lying out in the open. The Russians have retreated in the Kherson, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, and even on the edges of the Luhansk region, with heavy casualties on both sides. In Zaporizhzhia, where a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant has been shelled repeatedly, the game of nuclear chicken continues. With no end in sight to the war, it is hard to contemplate what it would take for Ukrainians to rebuild their lives and their country. The scale of the task is staggering.

So many sunflower farms, a major industry, lie burned and deserted. Ms. Kozyr, who had watched the wounded soldier lying on her kitchen floor, said her village had been destroyed, too.

[MUSIC PLAYING] If Vladimir Putin ever follows through with his threat to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, hes likely to use a very particular kind of nuclear weapon. Today, I talk to my colleague, Bill Broad on what that weapon is, how it works, and what it would mean to deploy it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Its Friday, October 7th. So Bill, two weeks ago, we did an episode with our colleague Anton. And he told us that Putin had effectively declared a chunk of Ukraine Russian territory. And he said that if it was attacked, he would fight back. And he kind of hinted that he would use his nuclear arsenal. So this whole week, the Ukrainians are making a lot of military advances in that very area that Putin was talking about. And so everyone, you know Im in DC here, is talking about this and kind of on edge. Are we in a new, more dangerous moment in the world? So we wanted to ask you, Bill, what would an attack like this look like? I mean, when I think of nuclear weapons, I think of a mushroom cloud? Is that what were talking about? bill broad Were not, although that tends to be the thing that we all conjure up in our minds, these big horrible things. We saw one over Hiroshima. Weve seen pictures of tests around the globe where these frightening huge things would scare and intimidate everybody into all these unthinkable scenarios. What were talking about now is extremely different. Its a whole different dark universe that grew up in parallel to this ginormous scary world of mushroom clouds. sabrina tavernise OK, different universe, they grew up in parallel. So tell me about that, Bill. How are the nuclear weapons of today different from the ones that we have in our mind? bill broad Theyre fundamentally much, much, much, much smaller. They call them tactical nukes. They are tiny fractions of the strength of the Hiroshima bomb and tiny, tiny little fractions of the super bombs and the city busters that everybody worried about during the Cold War. In comparison to all that and to everything weve known and thought about publicly for a long time, they are minuscule. sabrina tavernise So how did these smaller ones, in this new world youre talking about, come to be? bill broad Well, they all grew out of the very first atomic weapons. The one we all remember, was Hiroshima. [EXPLOSION] 1945 ended World War II. archived recording The city of Hiroshima lies prostrate after the withering blast which wiped out 53,000 of its population. bill broad The big mushroom cloud over this Japanese city and one over Nagasaki too. archived recording Four square miles of buildings leveled by the first of two small bombs that decided the fate of Japan. Thats whats indelibly imprinted on our minds. sabrina tavernise Right. archived recording Another evidence of the enemys final inability to wage war. bill broad Well, after that, we went into the next chapter of the Cold War, where there was this global race for bigger and better and more terrible weapons. archived recording History turns its most ominous page far out in mid-pacific, where in the Enewetak Atoll, the worlds most awesome weapon is readied for detonation. bill broad And they got enormously large compared to Hiroshima. They were called H-bombs. archived recording Here on a Elugelab Island, the cab or housing for the first hydrogen bomb takes shape after months of preparation. bill broad And we popped our first one in 1952. archived recording The pictures you are about to see have been released by the Department of Defense under presidential order. bill broad They put a device on an Island in the South Pacific. And they tested it. archived recording Five-er, four, three, two, one T zero. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] The ball of fire is three miles across as it shatters both land and sea. bill broad And it was 700 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb with a mushroom cloud that just went into the stratosphere. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] archived recording In seconds, the fireball erupts into a geyser the towers 25 miles into the stratosphere spreading into 100-mile wide mushroom cloud. bill broad I mean, it was so big it just blew peoples minds. archived recording Rising with the cloud are millions of cubic feet of radioactive ash. A virulent byproduct of the fusion bomb that will shower down over the area in approximately one hour. bill broad But the Soviets, not wanting to be outdone in this great race, archived recording [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] bill broad Detonated one that was [EXPLOSION] 3,000 times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb archived recording [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] bill broad I mean, imagine that one weapon, something you could fit in your closet there or it would sit comfortably in your living room, having the destructive power of 3,000 Hiroshimas. [MUSIC PLAYING] sabrina tavernise And this was the United States and the Soviet Union making these bigger and better bombs. bill broad Both of us in a big race. And this is the part of the history that we all kind of intuitively know. There was a race to make these super bombs and these city busters, and we got into this kind of straitjacket of mutually assured destruction, where nobody could do anything because if we did X theyd do Y, and wed annihilate each other. And because of how unthinkable the whole situation was, It was a standoff. sabrina tavernise OK, so those were the big bombs of the Cold War era, of the arms race, but what you said were talking about today is something different, right? Something smaller. So tell me about that. bill broad So while we were popping all these enormous big bombs that got everybodys attention, there was a whole parallel effort, under the radar, that the public really wasnt aware of, and I wasnt aware of as a reporter until late in my career, in which they developed bombs that were incredibly small. Were talking about things like a big toaster. One of them was called the Davy Crockett, after the great frontiersman and American folk hero. It was like a watermelon with fins on the back. sabrina tavernise But that means also, presumably, that they werent as strong, right? bill broad No, thats it. They werent as strong. Their blasts were a tiny fraction of the Hiroshima bomb. The Davy Crockett, this little watermelon with fins, it was 1,000th of the power of the Hiroshima bomb, but these bombs were not meant to blow up cities. They were meant for the battlefield. They were small, portable but still powerful enough to blow up a bridge or take out a dam or destroy a train yard or a storage tank or a command bunker vaporizing it, gone, off the battlefield. And it was all from nuclear technology, which put into a tiny little package the power of a ginormous conventional weapon. It just put a huge amount of power in your hands. sabrina tavernise But, Bill, why though? I mean, why did they feel like they needed these small things? bill broad They needed them for Europe. It was a techie fix for a terrible situation. They wanted little bombs that could stop the Soviet hordes cold. The Soviets could, with a snap of their fingers, create armies with millions of men, and they did. Their standing army was something like 4 or 5 million people. We couldnt do that in the West. The democracies couldnt get that many people up on the front lines. So rather than turning ourselves into dictatorships and forcing everybody to march to the front lines, we went, hey, guys, lets make teeny-weeny little bombs thatll intimidate the Soviets and stop these hordes. Theyll know about it. Well advertise it. Well send signals. Well let them know that our planes are practicing with this. That we have nuclear artillery shells 8-inches wide that exactly look like conventional shells but guess what? Theyre nuclear. Itll be a real bad day on the invasion front. sabrina tavernise So the West is essentially thinking, OK, we dont have the manpower to counter the Soviets who can just get everybody in their country to fight, and instead, they were going to use this newfangled and potentially, quite devastating new weapon to stop them. bill broad Right, and they went wild with it. [MUSIC PLAYING] NATO, our Western European partners, put, get this, 7,400, 7400 of these weapons all across Western Europe at the peak of the Cold War. It was like you could have one in every kitchen. They were everywhere. And they were ready to go, at a moments notice, to try to counteract the hordes. [MUSIC PLAYING] sabrina tavernise And what about the Soviets, bill? Did they also develop these smaller tactical nuclear weapons? bill broad They did, but it took a while. Typically, in the history of the arms races, we have always been the leaders. We developed the first H-bombs. We developed the first A-bombs. The Soviets always would lag a few to many years behind, but they eventually started doing this too. And we kind of got into yet another arms race. A tit-for-tat race with smaller bombs that the public didnt really follow that was another kind of invisible part of the East-West standoff. [MUSIC PLAYING] sabrina tavernise So eventually, the Soviet Union collapses Cold War ends. What happens to all these things? bill broad Well, we come to agreements to cut back our very big arsenals with these city busters that would get flung halfway around the world. We went from tens of thousands of these things down to what today, in East and West, are big long-range arsenals of about 1,500 weapons. sabrina tavernise Wow. bill broad But the little stuff has a more checkered history. Right at the end of the Cold War, we both agreed to get these off the battlefield because they were so small, we didnt want terrorists and crazy people running off with them. sabrina tavernise It was the time of Osama bin Laden and of rising Islamic terrorism. bill broad Absolutely, so there was a big push, a bilateral push, to get these things in safe places. And the result of that is that in the West, a lot of these small weapons got disassembled and taken to bunkers, where they sit today. Theyre in parts and pieces and maybe some of the material turned back into just handy-dandy material for the day we might want it. We now have on the order of 100 tactical weapons in Western Europe. sabrina tavernise Just 100? bill broad Just 100, right. sabrina tavernise Why did NATO keep so few. What was the thinking there? bill broad The thinking, it was that these things were dangerous because they were so small. They were easy to lose and easy to be misplaced. And they didnt have the serious, serious command and control functions that we had for these big super weapons and city busters that would go on top of intercontinental ballistic missiles. So the decision was made to just downsize radically, which they did. sabrina tavernise And what about the Russians? Did they reciprocate? bill broad They did in the sense that they pulled a lot of these tacticals off the battlefield and put them into storage areas, but unlike the US, they didnt disassemble them. So these weapons are still around. 2000 of them ready to go. sabrina tavernise Wow. Thats a lot more. bill broad Yes, it could make for a terrible bad day if they started going off. sabrina tavernise Its kind of surprising that the US would just voluntarily get rid of these things while Russia kept theirs. Wasnt this process governed by the same type of treaties and arrangements that they use for the big bombs? bill broad No, and thats one of the surprising parts of this whole story. These things were never regulated by treaties. We just decided to ditch them. The Cold War was over. The Soviet Union collapsed. Their military apparatus was a shambles. Their economy was crippled. War was not going to break out. The much feared invasion of West Germany and Western Europe was not about to happen. They could barely feed their soldiers, much less marshal a group of them to invade Europe. We didnt need these weapons anymore, and nukes are unimaginably dangerous. Nobody wanted to use these things. sabrina tavernise OK, so we decided we didnt need them. We got rid of most of them, even though we had no guarantee that Russia would reciprocate. bill broad Right, so nobody thought about this a lot in public. In the secret councils of Washington, in the National Security Council and the Pentagon, they were just old news. [MUSIC PLAYING] Until Russia, in recent years, emerged as a major aggressor on the world stage plowing into Ukraine and starting to make all these threats again about its great nuclear arsenal. [MUSIC PLAYING] sabrina tavernise Well be right back. So, Bill, the Russians have a lot of these smaller, tactical, nuclear weapons. If Putin decides he wants to use one, what does that actually look like? What are his options? bill broad Well, it all depends, right? The one that analysts talk about over and over is the shock-and-awe technique, where Putin says, let me take one of these things. Theyre not so big. The world wont end, but Ill take it and Ill pop it off over the Baltic or the Black Sea. No mushroom cloud, just this instantaneous bright flash like all of a sudden a second sun. The satellites will notice. The West will notice. NATO and the US will notice. And it will send a terrifying message that Im willing to break the nuclear taboo thats been in place for 77 years. Or, if he wanted to take out, say, a Ukrainian military base, one of his main options would be this missile that our NATO partners know very well called the Iskander. It has a range of about 300 miles. It has two big tactical rockets that can get carried on a truck. Usually, the Iskanders have conventional warheads, but they also take nuclear warheads. So Putin could order the nuclear Iskander warheads to be taken out of storage, run up in Russia to somewhere relatively close to the front lines, and aim it toward that base. Now, thats not the end of the story because all these detonations of nuclear weapons have lots of options, mainly, the height of the burst. sabrina tavernise So there are all these different dimensions to how this thing could actually be used, including where it physically explodes. bill broad Yes, lets say you just wanted to scare the bejesus out of them. Maybe youd detonate it 1,000 feet above the base. Maybe you just start some fires in the surrounding woods and kill maybe 100 people rather than 1,000 or something. But if you really want to create a nightmare for somebody, make sure its a ground burst. Because then all the stuff that gets vaporized on the ground becomes radioactive. So you multiply the radiation many, many, many times over if you do a ground burst, which is why sites can be uninhabitable for a long time. The Hiroshima bomb was detonated at a height of 1,500 feet. There was prompt radiation. It happened very quickly, and that killed a lot of people, but there wasnt this radiation that lasted for years and decades. They went around with Geiger counters through Hiroshima afterwards, and there was very little residual radiation. So how these things are detonated is as important as what they are. sabrina tavernise Im remembering now, Chernobyl. And I actually have a friend who was living in Belarus at the time and said that the wind carried the radiation toward him as a child and that everybody remembers that. And I guess Im thinking if Putin explodes a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, wouldnt that be a risk for him as well? The wind carrying the radiation and effectively, making parts of Russia toxic? bill broad Right, thats a great question. And the answer is it depends on what mother nature is thinking that day. Usually, at the latitude of Kyiv, youre right smack dab in what they call the westerlies. These are trade winds. They blow constantly from west to east. And thats what you would normally have had over Chernobyl, which is very close to Kyiv. On that day, however, instead of the westerlies blowing, which would have taken the radiation to Kazakhstan, the winds were coming out of the south and the southeast. So the radiation got blown north to Belarus and to Russia. So its this fickle aspect of nature that really has the final vote in all this. sabrina tavernise So it sounds like Putin has a lot of options for how he could actually use these tactical weapons, but at the same time, theres a significant element of risk for him. bill broad Exactly right, huge uncertainty, technical uncertainty, political uncertainty, right? Hes going into this world that we havent been in in modern times. Its full of all kinds of scary unknowns. sabrina tavernise Well, so lets talk about that. What are the consequences if Putin actually does this? If he actually detonates a bomb in Ukraine or anywhere in the region, say, what would be the response from the rest of the world? bill broad Well, Russias hoping that they would escalate to deescalate, which is a kind of a fancy way of saying that, well, the shock and awe of it would mean that everybody on the other side would basically throw up their hands and surrender. sabrina tavernise And would that happen? bill broad My understanding is that the Biden administration has thought about it a lot. And they think that the civilized world would be so appalled that even Putins best buddies, China and India and these dictatorial countries that get in bed with Russia, they would all be so appalled that he would suddenly be losing huge political support. Sanctions, all of a sudden, would come in with huge force, and the administrations game plan, as I understand it, often through the eyes of my good colleague David Sanger, who reports on this stuff deeply in Washington, is that they would not respond with a nuclear detonation. sabrina tavernise And is the reason because they dont have any of those tactical nukes anymore, the small ones, or is it because theyre afraid of escalation? bill broad I think its both those things. We dont have those tactical nuclear weapons to be able to climb that little escalatory ladder anymore, which was the thing in the Cold War. There was this whole theory of escalatory cycles which were supposed to deter the attacks. They pop a five-kiloton bomb, we pop a five-kiloton bomb, but now, I think the thought process is, we dont want to get into a tit for tat where suddenly one of the few tactical weapons that we have in Europe gets used on a Russian city and Putin decides to take out Chicago or Los Angeles. So the prevailing wisdom in the administration appears to be that we would use our conventional firepower to retaliate or share that conventional firepower with Ukraine, so they could retaliate. And we do have this unbelievable arsenal of conventional weapons, which are hugely precise, incredibly smart, filled with chips, guided by satellites, and could rain down on Mother Russia in a way that she would never forget. sabrina tavernise One thing that I dont really get about Putin and the nuclear scenario is that his whole goal is to actually take over Ukraine is to sort of have it as Russian territory. Thats what hes trying to do. So why would he risk poisoning a whole lot of the territory of the country hes trying to take over? It just doesnt really make any sense. bill broad Right, none of it, really to me, makes a whole lot of sense. The only thing that makes sense is not using it on a battlefield using it as a shock and awe technique to say, Im willing to cross the line. Are you? Now, the thing to keep in mind is throughout all the escalations in this war, the United States has found zero evidence that nuclear weapons that are in storage units are being taken out. Submarines, in their pens, are not being put out to sea with nuclear missiles, which would happen if we were facing Armageddon. Special trucks are not pulling up to cruise-missile batteries with nuclear warheads. sabrina tavernise But whats that telling us? bill broad Its telling us that were in this period of bluff and bluster. sabrina tavernise Hmm. bill broad There are no concrete preparations, that Im aware of, that Washingtons aware of, to wage a nuclear war, not even with one of these little babies. Its still this great drama that Putin is running, and it has to do with scare tactics. sabrina tavernise Its almost like the threats themselves are his power, right? bill broad Right. sabrina tavernise Hes in peak power now, and as soon as he uses them -- bill broad It goes away. And not only goes away, he, as a force on the world stage, collapses. sabrina tavernise Right. bill broad Thats the US playbook, and I think theres something to it. sabrina tavernise Which makes me think he wont actually use them, right? bill broad Oh, I hope so. To the extent that hes a rational player, he wont, but the thing about Vladimir Putin, hes unpredictable. And hes using that to his advantage, right? sabrina tavernise Indeed. bill broad Primarily, with this invasion, which all the experts said wouldnt happen. And it did. sabrina tavernise Right, the wild card is he surprised us a lot, and thats the real danger. bill broad Right, the danger is that Vladimir Putin would usher us into an unpredictable new age. Would this start a chain reaction of events? Would people start rearming themselves. Would people start popping bombs. And what if it was a small bomb? And oh, it wasnt so bad. He crossed this line, and maybe we should start using these in other conflicts, and who knows where that goes? You could go up the escalatory chain reaction and they get bigger and bigger and next thing you know, theyre dusting off the old super bombs from the Cold War and starting to think about vaporizing big cities. It goes to so many potentially bad places, you quickly get back into that unthinkable territory, which was the thing that made the Cold War work. [MUSIC PLAYING] Because on both sides it was unthinkable. There was a game plan. And everybody knew the rules. The Soviet embassy and the American embassy people would all get together on holidays, and their children went to the same schools in Moscow. And everybody knew the game. We were comfortable with the standoff. But now, youre starting in a asymmetrical situation rather than the standoff. We dont know where this game goes. And thats what makes it so frightening to me as a reporter who watches this stuff. It just seems like its a chain reaction you dont want to start because you have no idea where its going to go. [MUSIC PLAYING] sabrina tavernise Bill, thank you. bill broad Thank you. sabrina tavernise On Thursday night, President Joe Biden said the risk of, quote ""nuclear Armageddon is at its highest since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962."" Biden, who was speaking at a fundraiser in New York City, said, that Putin was quote ""not joking"" when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Well be right back.

My pardon will remove this burden on them. sabrina tavernise Marijuana is fully legal in about 20 states. And Biden said he wanted to stop sending people to jail for conduct that is already permitted in a lot of the country. The vast majority of simple marijuana possession charges are brought by the states, not the federal government. And Biden encouraged states to follow suit noting, that there were racial disparities around prosecution and conviction. archived recording (joe biden) Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana.

Russia said it foiled Ukraines attempts this week to strike Crimea.,"Image The Defense Department is sending more rockets for the powerful HIMARS launchers the United States has provided to Ukraine, which have enabled strikes deep behind enemy lines. Credit... Corey Dickstein/Savannah Morning News, via Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The United States is sending a new influx of arms and equipment that Ukraine will need for its counteroffensive against Russian troops in the countrys south, the Pentagon said on Friday. The Defense Department will also continue to send a steady stream of rockets for the HIMARS launchers that have been credited with destroying Russian command posts and ammunition depots, and other artillery designed to disrupt supply lines. Taken together, the new shipment of up to $775 million of weapons and supplies from the Pentagons stockpiles illustrates an emerging dual strategy: fueling Ukraines immediate artillery fight, while also helping to build up an arsenal to support a counterattack near Kherson, in the countrys south, that has yet to fully materialize. The latest shipment includes 40 armored vehicles equipped with giant rollers to clear minefields ahead of any Ukraine ground operation, as well as 50 armored troop-carrying Humvees, 1,500 TOW guided missiles and 1,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles. ""The mine-clearing is a really good example of how the Ukrainians will need this sort of capability to be able to push their forces forward and retake territory,"" a senior Defense Department official told reporters on a conference call on Friday. The Pentagon is also sending more high-speed anti-radiation missiles, or HARMs -- air-to-ground weapons designed to seek and destroy Russian air defense radar. Military technicians have figured out how to integrate the American missile on Ukraines Soviet-designed MiG fighter jets to help defeat one of the biggest threats to the Ukrainian air force. The package also includes the HIMARS rockets, 16 105-millimeter howitzers and 36,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as 15 ScanEagle drones to help spot Russian targets and relay location information to the gunners. For now, the United States has limited to 16 the number of HIMARS launchers sent to Ukraine, fearing that providing more would lead to burning through the Pentagons stockpile of satellite-guided rockets and eventually endanger U.S. combat readiness. Pentagon officials have emphasized in recent days that its resupply of ammunition for various artillery systems has now reached a regular, sustainable level that Ukrainian commanders can count on as they plan operations. The shipment, the Biden administrations 19th overall to Ukraine, comes as fighting in Kherson, in the south, and the Donbas region, in the east, has largely ground to a standstill. A Russian offensive to seize Donetsk Province, part of the Donbas, has stalled -- partly, American officials said, because Moscow rushed several thousand troops to the south to counter the anticipated Ukrainian offensive there and partly because of the effects of the HIMARS strikes. ""Right now, I would say that you are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,"" the senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. ""Youre seeing this hollowing out of the Russian forces in Ukraine."" But when pressed by reporters, the official said that the Ukrainians lacked sufficient troops and combat power to drive the Russians from their defensive positions. ""We havent seen a significant retake of territory, but we do see a significant weakening of Russian positions in a variety of locations,"" the official said. The official repeatedly declined to comment on a series of attacks and other explosions in Crimea over the past two weeks. Ukrainian officials privately attribute the attacks to an elite Ukrainian special forces unit operating behind enemy lines with the help of local partisan fighters. The strikes have shocked Russian commanders in Crimea, who thought their forces and weapons depots were out of reach of Ukrainian attacks, officials said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in an overnight address on Thursday, said that a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces had reclaimed ""more than half a thousand square kilometers of territory and dozens of settlements"" from Russian forces in the Kherson region since the start of the month. But as Russian forces were pushed back on the ground, they continued to strike from the air, stepping up their artillery and missile attacks on civilians in urban centers. The city of Zaporizhzhia, Mr. Zelensky said, is ""subjected to massive rocket attacks every day."" At least 22 civilians were killed and 32 injured in Russian attacks over the past 24 hours, a senior official in Mr. Zelenskys office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said Friday morning in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Much of Russias firepower was focused on the south of Ukraine, where Ukraines military on Friday accused Russia of using four Iranian-made ""kamikaze"" drones to strike Zaporizhzhia and the city of Mykolaiv. Overnight nearly 40 Russian rockets hit another city, Nikopol, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, damaging at least 10 homes, several apartment blocks and other infrastructure, according to the head of the regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko. He said that further shelling on Friday evening killed one man and wounded another. Russian artillery fire in the Berislav district of Kherson Province hit civilians who were in their yards, rather than sheltering, the regional police said on Friday. They did not say how many people were killed or wounded. Ukrainian officials have appealed for everybody living in the path of the offensive in the south to evacuate, and thousands have fled the fighting. Many have gone to Zaporizhzhia, a large regional center on the Dnipro River. There, rescue workers found more bodies on Friday as they cleared the rubble from a missile strike on a residential area a day earlier, raising the death toll to 12, including two children, with more probably still under the debris, local officials said. ""We had many victims who have been injured and are in hospital, and 15 other people have been reported missing, so we continue searching for them,"" said Anatolii Kurtiev, the acting mayor, at a morning news conference. Large-scale humanitarian convoys out of the city have been suspended. Russian forces were also shelling critical infrastructure in the city, he said, but the water and electricity supply was still working. Ukrainians who live in areas now back under the countrys control face acute shortages of food and electricity and the problems will only grow worse as winter approaches, the deputy head of the Kherson regional council, Serhiy Khlan, told journalists.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/07/world/russia-ukraine-war-news
[],"Latest U.S. Military Package for Ukraine Suggests Shift in Focus to Long, Open-Ended War",,"Rather than sending more powerful HIMARS rocket launchers from its stockpile, the U.S. is ordering them from Lockheed-Martin, so delivery will take years. European Union officials proposed a new round of sanctions in response to Russias recent actions to escalate the war.","Image A High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) produced by Lockheed Martin during combat training at the Yakima Training Center, Wash. Credit... Tony Overman/The Olympian, via Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said on Wednesday it would send an additional $1.1 billion in long-term military aid to Ukraine, including 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers, or HIMARS, one of the most vaunted weapons of the seven-month war with Russia. But unlike the 16 HIMARS the military rushed to Ukraine from its existing stockpiles over the summer, these new weapons will be ordered from the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, and will take ""a few years"" to deliver, a senior Defense Department official told reporters. Shifting the source of Ukrainian military supplies from the Pentagons own stockpile, which is large but not limitless, to items newly manufactured by the defense industry indicates that the White House and military leaders are transitioning to a sustainable model Kyiv can depend on for an open-ended war with Russia. Privately, American commanders have also voiced concern that if the United States sends more HIMARS vehicles immediately, the Ukrainians will burn through the rocket ammunition provided by the Pentagon too quickly, potentially jeopardizing American military readiness in coming months. The promise of new military aid comes at a critical time in the war, when Ukraine has the momentum on the battlefield, and has retaken vast stretches of land in the east and is pressing entrenched Russian forces in the south. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, is mobilizing up to 300,000 reservists in an attempt to shore up his forces, and Ukrainian commanders are pushing to try to take back as much territory as they can before the winter freeze forces both sides to slow their operations and dig in. The HIMARs systems have proven effective at cutting Russian supply lines, destroying ammunition depots, bridges, rail links, and troop concentrations far beyond the lines. Asked why the Pentagon didnt just send more of the advanced rocket launchers from its own inventories -- as President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly requested -- the senior Defense Department official sidestepped the question, saying the future delivery was to ensure Ukraine ""will have what it needs for the long haul to deter future threats."" Pentagon officials have said for weeks that with the American HIMARS and 10 similar rocket systems already delivered to the battlefield -- 26 rocket-launchers in all -- Ukraine has enough of the weapons to attack the Russian targets it wants. Indeed, the satellite-guided rockets fired by HIMARS have struck more than 400 Russian ammunition depots, command posts and radars. The new shipment announced on Wednesday also includes 150 Humvees, 150 vehicles for towing artillery, radars, counter-drone systems and body armor, which the senior Pentagon official said would be delivered from manufacturers in the next six to 24 months. That brings to $16.2 billion in total military aid that the United States has committed to Ukraine since the war started in February. The $1.1 billion in new equipment will be paid for by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a congressionally approved fund that allows Ukrainian leaders to purchase military goods directly from the defense industry. At the same virtual briefing for reporters on Wednesday, a senior U.S. military official said the first ""small group"" of Russians from the 300,000 conscripts ordered mobilized had arrived in Ukraine. The official did not provide details on how many new conscripts had been sent to the battlefield or where they were located. But the official, who like the senior Pentagon official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, expressed skepticism that the Kremlin could properly mobilize, train and equip anywhere near that total number of new troops. ""Just the mechanics of outfitting that size of a force is very difficult,"" the senior U.S. military official said.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/28/world/russia-ukraine-war-news
[],Can Russia Keep Firing Missiles at Cities? And What Defenses Does Ukraine Need?,,Efforts to help Ukraine shield its cities may depend on the scarcity of both Russian missiles and Western air defense systems.,"With a new wave of Russian airstrikes this week that slammed into the capital and more than a dozen other cities, Western officials are under increasing pressure to speed the delivery of missiles, launchers and other sophisticated air defense systems to help protect Ukraine. Some are already on the way. A first shipment of high-tech, heat-seeking missiles from Germany -- so new that even Berlins forces have not deployed them yet -- was delivered Tuesday. France, the Netherlands and Spain pledged this week to send more air defense missiles too. And the United States said it would hasten delivery of two missile launchers, the type that have protected Washington since 2005. Those defense systems fire missiles from mobile launchers to intercept incoming aircraft, missiles, rockets or other projectiles, and are crucial to protecting Ukraine in ways that its relatively small and struggling air force cannot. Ukraine has air defense systems of its own, including old Soviet-era weapons, but it is using up ammunition at a great rate, and both Kyiv and its Western allies say it needs much more. ""We will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes, we will step up our support, and in particular, we will provide more air defense systems to Ukraine,"" Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said in Brussels.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/world/europe/russia-missiles-ukraine.html

Some residents even hid in their homes, terrified that voting against Russias annexation would lead to their being abducted, or worse. As Russia began orchestrating staged voting in referendums across Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine on Friday, Ukrainians in those areas expressed a mix of anger, defiance and fear that their homeland was being usurped by force in what they called a sham vote. The aim of the hastily called referendums -- supported by pro-Russian residents and their proxies -- was apparent: to give President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a legally bogus pretext to gobble up their country. And they brought back memories of staged votes in 2014 in Crimea that were swiftly followed by Russias annexation of the peninsula. Ukrainian Regions Where Referendums Are Taking Place Kremlin-backed officials in four partly occupied regions of southern and eastern Ukraine are staging referendums on joining Russia. The voting is widely seen as a sham by Western officials. A similar process was held in Crimea in 2014.

Russian officials were going door to door, she said, to deliver ballots, peering into the windows of homes that did not answer their call. ""We are against these occupiers,"" Tina said, ""but we do not have a right to say no -- we cannot refuse."" Tina, who said she has participated in protests against the Russian occupation, said that her fiances relatives had locked their gates and doors and turned off their lights, as Ukrainian authorities had advised. But she was worried that their address would be noted and there would be negative repercussions if they refused to answer the door. ""After living side by side with them for more than six months now, we have learned that any refusal could result in a direct ticket to the basement,"" she said, using a phrase Ukrainians under occupation in Kherson, a port city in the countrys south, have started using to describe abductions by occupying forces. Olha, a Ukrainian who spoke on Thursday night to friends in Enerhodar, a Russian-controlled city in southeastern Ukraine near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, said men aged 18 to 35 were being prevented from leaving the city. Echoing the concerns of many Ukrainians, she said she was nervous that Russian annexation would force young men to join the Russian military and fight against fellow Ukrainians. That has already happened in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk occupied by Russia since 2014. ""They want to conscript them to the Russian armed forces,"" Olha said. ""And Ukrainians will have to fight against Ukrainians,"" she said, stopping as she broke into tears. Like others interviewed for this article, she did not want to use her full name out of concern for her safety. Andriy, 44, who has friends and relatives in Kherson, said he had spoken to them in recent days and they had told him that it wasnt possible to leave the city because of the referendum.

Juan Barreto/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images BAKHMUT, Ukraine -- The steady rattle of machine-gun fire resonated across the outskirts of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on Saturday morning. The sound, interspersed with the shriek of rockets and mortar fire, indicated one thing: The Russian troops were getting closer. Bakhmut, a city with a prewar population of 70,000, is critical to Russias objective of taking the rest of the mineral-rich Donbas region. When Russian forces captured the industrial city of Lysychansk in early July and cemented their control of Luhansk, one of two provinces in the Donbas, Bakhmut soon became the focus of Russias slow advance. And even after Russia took a crippling defeat in Ukraines northeast last week, when its troops lost dozens of villages and roughly a thousand square miles of territory around the city of Kharkiv, its forces still continued to attack Bakhmut. Ukrainian soldiers and commanders believe Bakhmut is in an increasingly tenuous position as Russian forces press from the east and southeast in an attempt to cut off the countrys supplies. Soldiers on the front line around the city have claimed that Russian forces in the area are mainly composed of troops from the Wagner Group, a private military company with ties to the Kremlin. Wagner troops have fought in places such as Syria and Libya -- countries with a history of Russian intervention -- and Ukrainian soldiers say they are deploying Russian prisoners onto the front lines. That the Ukrainian forces were being attacked by inmates -- and not just regular Russian ranks -- suggested a reason there seemed an unending supply of soldiers around Bakhmut attacking them, Ukrainian troops said. On Tuesday, a video posted online and analyzed by The New York Times shows the Wagner Group promising convicts that they will be released from prison in return for a six-month combat tour in Ukraine. It is unclear when the video was filmed. After Russias humiliating defeat around Ukraines capital, Kyiv, in the spring, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that capturing the Donbas, a region roughly the size of New Hampshire, would be one of the wars primary aims. At a regional summit in Uzbekistan on Friday, Mr. Putin reiterated that the ""main goal"" of his ""special military operation"" was to seize the Donbas, despite losses in the northeast and Ukraines ongoing offensive in the south, near the port city of Kherson. Russian troops currently control much of the Donbas, a region of rolling hills, mining towns and sunflower fields that seem to scrape against the sky. Moscows dominance there stems from military advances earlier this summer and the creation of the Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway republics by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. In the southeastern corner of the Donbas, Russian forces recently made small advances farther west, all but capturing the village of Pisky near the Donetsk airport. But Moscows troops have encountered well-manned secondary and tertiary Ukrainian defensive lines that have been in place for years. As winter approaches, Ukrainian forces are in a position to reclaim some of Russias summer gains in the Donbas, especially around the small city of Lyman, an important railway juncture. It has been further isolated from Russian resupply following Ukraines recent capture of Izium and Kupyansk in the northwest. Lyman sits on the northeastern side of the Seversky Donets, a river that has given the Russian forces a de facto defensive boundary for much of the war. If Lyman falls under Ukrainian control, commanders and soldiers said, they will be in a far more advantageous position to repel future Russian offensives.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/17/world/ukraine-russia-war
[],Russia Seeks to Force Ukrainians to Fight Their Countrymen,,"Russia is stepping up its conscription efforts even as it forces residents to vote in staged referendums that could lead to annexation, according to Ukrainian officials, witnesses and rights groups.","Image In the occupied area of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine on Thursday. Credit... Associated Press KYIV, Ukraine -- As military officers across Russia race to enlist hundreds of thousands of men to fight in Ukraine, the Kremlin is also looking to bolster its flagging recruitment efforts by dragooning Ukrainians in occupied territories to fight against their own nation. In two regions, Kherson and Zaporizka, the Russian occupiers are beginning to round up men to fight even as they are also forcing residents to vote in a sham referendum on joining Russia. All men ages 18 to 35 have been forbidden to leave and ordered to report for military duty, according to witnesses and Ukrainian officials, who say that many men are now in hiding or looking to escape. Since President Vladimir V. Putin declared a ""partial mobilization"" last week that is sweeping up hundreds of thousands of Russians, Moscows forces in Ukraine ""dont let men out,"" said Halyna Odnorih, a coordinator in the city of Zaporizhzhia for people who have escaped occupied regions. ""Many people are calling us and asking whether we could help them to evacuate. But unfortunately we cant."" The drive to compel Ukrainians to fight against other Ukrainians is part of a broader effort by Moscow to mobilize hundreds of thousands of new fighters as its forces suffer huge casualties and struggle to hold off Ukrainian advances in the east and south. It also shows how the Kremlin is defying international condemnation and pushing forward with efforts to cleave Ukraine. Voting in staged referendums continued on Sunday in four occupied regions amid a backdrop of violence and repression, a likely prelude to an announcement of annexation by Moscow that Ukrainian officials warned could come as soon as next week. After that, analysts warn, the Kremlin could declare the areas Russian territory and protected by the might of its full arsenal, including the worlds largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Mr. Putin had resisted ordering a mobilization for months, but his decision underscored the Kremlins concerns over high casualties -- American officials estimate that over 80,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured in the war -- as well as its commitment to a prolonged struggle to bend Ukraine to its will. Thousands have been arrested for protesting the call-ups in Russia in the face of harsh laws against dissent. Forced conscription also continues in the two other occupied regions where Russian officials are staging referendums, Luhansk and Donetsk, eastern areas that have been partially controlled by Moscow since 2014. In both, many men volunteered to fight for Russia before its full-scale invasion began in February. But as casualties rose -- and many fighters were dispatched to the front with little training or support -- a large-scale conscription effort has been instituted to replenish the ranks. Currently, Russia controls nearly all of Luhansk, a large portion of Kherson and less than half of Donetsk and Zaporizka. It is also stepping up conscription in Crimea, the southern peninsula that it illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, according to human rights groups and witnesses. Those groups say the Russian military has been disproportionately conscripting Crimean Tatars, an ethnic minority group that has faced persecution by Russian officials ""with the apparent goal of completely silencing dissent on the peninsula,"" according to a 2017 Human Rights Watch report. Alim Aliev, a co-founder of the rights organization Crimea SOS, said that 80 percent of summons to the Russian Army in Crimea were issued to Crimean Tatars. ""Its a new type of repression,"" he said. ""We advise people not to come to the public gatherings, not to take the notifications and not to come to the military committees."" Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, called the conscription campaign in Crimea ""a real ethnic genocide and an enormous tragedy for the entire nation."" ""Forcing citizens to a war in the occupied regions is nothing more than Moscows attempt to cleanse the territory of a disloyal population,"" he said on Sunday. The recruitment of unwilling soldiers carries obvious risks for Russia. Military analysts have said that conscripts from Luhansk and Donetsk were part of the forces whose stunning collapse in the northeastern Kharkiv region this month allowed for Ukraines most successful offensive operation of the war. The Ukrainian intelligence service said last week that Ukrainian recruits sent by Russia to fight in Kherson have ""refused to take part in combat missions."" Citing intercepted communications and interviews with relatives, the agency said that Russian commanders had threatened to send conscripts ""to the front line without weapons if they refuse to follow orders.""",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/25/world/russia-ukraine-putin-news

Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times When President Biden delivered a blunt warning at a fund-raiser last Thursday that the war in Ukraine could devolve into a nuclear ""Armageddon,"" he raised a terrifying prospect that many Americans had not worried much about since the end of the Cold War. White House officials did not walk back Mr. Bidens statement; they knew it reflected a deep concern that has sent Pentagon and intelligence officials gaming out different scenarios, from a test detonation over the Black Sea to the use of a nuclear weapon against, say, a Ukrainian military base. But the White House emphasized on Friday that the United States has seen no signs that Russia is gearing up to use nuclear weapons. But it has been 30 years since most Americans have talked about nuclear deterrence, the difference between tactical and strategic weapons and what havoc a 10 kiloton bomb can trigger versus a 100 kiloton one. So what was the president talking about? Here is what we know: As his army loses ground, Putin has been rattling his nuclear saber. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in an angry speech last month full of bluster and anti-American rhetoric, clearly raised the specter of using nuclear weapons to hold on to his slipping territorial gains in Ukraine. Mr. Putin said he would use ""all available means"" to defend Russian territory -- which he declared includes four provinces of eastern Ukraine that Russia has attempted to illegally annex. He also argued that the atomic bombs the United States dropped on Japan in 1945 ""created a precedent."" Mr. Biden, last Thursday, said: ""For the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we have a direct threat to the use of nuclear weapons, if in fact things continue down the path they are going."" So far, U.S. officials say they think the chances of Russia using nuclear weapons are low. Senior American officials say they have seen no evidence that Mr. Putin is moving any of his nuclear assets, especially in Russias stockpile of about 2,000 small tactical weapons. Even though Mr. Putin called for his nuclear forces to go on alert in late February, there has been no evidence that they did. But events like the attack on the Kerch Strait Bridge over the weekend worry officials who fear that a humiliated Putin is more likely to lash out. Still, U.S. officials have been weighing possible scenarios. Senior U.S. officials are far more concerned than they were at the start of the conflict about the possibility of Mr. Putin deploying tactical nuclear weapons. After a series of humiliating retreats, astoundingly high casualty rates and a deeply unpopular move to draft young Russian men into service, Mr. Putin clearly sees the threat of his nuclear arsenal as a way to instill fear and perhaps to recover some respect for Russias power. For months, computer simulations from the Pentagon, American nuclear labs and intelligence agencies have been trying to model what might happen and how the United States could respond. The threshold at which Mr. Putin would resort to nuclear weapons -- or how he would use them -- is far from clear. The primary utility of a tactical nuclear strike, many U.S. officials say, would be as part of a last-ditch effort by Mr. Putin to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive by threatening to make parts of the country uninhabitable. Russia would most likely deploy tactical nuclear arms, which have smaller payloads than intercontinental ballistic missiles. Analysts say that if Mr. Putin does resort to nuclear weapons, the likeliest scenario would be a relatively small tactical strike, either on the battlefield or as a warning shot in an unpopulated area. Tactical weapons come in many sizes and varieties, some with a small fraction of the destructive power of the bombs the United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and some with far larger power. They can be fired from an artillery gun or delivered with a missile. But they are hard to use and are difficult to control. How much destruction -- and lingering radiation -- would result depends on factors that include the size of the weapon and the winds. Even a small nuclear explosion could kill thousands and render a base or downtown area uninhabitable for years. The risks for Mr. Putin could easily outweigh any gains: Depending on the natural winds, the radiation released by Russian weapons could easily blow back into Russian territory. The West has been vague about how it would respond. Mr. Biden recently said that the United States would ""respond forcefully"" if Mr. Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon. In May he wrote in an essay for The Times that ""any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale"" would ""entail severe consequences."" His national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sept. 25 there would be ""catastrophic consequences"" and those had been communicated to Moscow. But that does not necessarily mean a retaliatory nuclear strike, which could trigger a broader war. For months, administration officials have said they could think of almost no circumstances in which a nuclear detonation by Russia in Ukraine would result in a nuclear response from the United States. There have been discussions of several other military responses, such as using conventional weapons against a base or unit from which the attack originated, or giving Ukrainian forces the weaponry to launch that counterattack. But many of the options under discussion also involve nonmilitary steps, including further cutting Russia off from the world economy and casting Mr. Putin as an international pariah. It would be a chance, some officials say, to bring China and India, along with much of Asia and Africa, into the effort to impose sanctions on Russia, taking away some of the biggest remaining markets for its oil and gas.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/09/world/russia-ukraine-war-news

Russian strikes in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih sent water gushing downstream as residents worried about flooding.","President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine made an unannounced visit to Izium, in northeastern Ukraine, on Wednesday, where Russian forces had retreated about a week earlier. IZIUM, Ukraine -- Standing in a cold drizzle among wreckage left behind by Russias chaotic retreat, President Volodymyr Zelensky looked to the sky on Wednesday toward Ukraines flag flying over the main square of a city reclaimed just days ago in a stunning counterattack. ""Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing -- the flag of Ukraine,"" Mr. Zelensky told soldiers in front of the citys bombed-out municipal building. ""Our blue and yellow flag is already flying in de-occupied Izium. And it will be so in every Ukrainian city and village."" The presidents unannounced appearance in Izium, about nine miles from the front in Ukraines northeast, was a tangible sign of Ukraines soaring morale and its growing boldness -- a demonstration that the military could ensure Mr. Zelenskys safety even near the front and that it would staunchly defend what it had reclaimed. Russian soldiers fled the city in a humiliating retreat last week, abandoning tanks, trucks and boxes of ammunition in the streets, and Mr. Zelenskys visit underscored that humiliation. Image On a news media tour arranged by the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian soldiers posed in front of a sign at the entrance to Izium on Wednesday. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times After addressing the soldiers, Mr. Zelensky stood for a moment of silence to commemorate those killed in the fighting. He then posed for photographs with soldiers and left, lest the Russian military launch a missile at the square while he and government ministers were in easy range, aides said. After months telegraphing an intention to counterattack in the south, the Ukrainian Army this month staged a lightning offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, capturing thousands of square miles of territory, dozens of towns and villages and important centers like Izium, a railway hub for eastern Ukraine. After the defeat of Russian troops in the battle for Ukraines capital, Kyiv, early in the war, the Kharkiv counteroffensive has been Ukraines most successful military operation. Ukrainian officials are now seeking to capitalize on two key gains: demoralization in the Russian Army and the greater willingness of Western governments to assist Ukraine with weapons supplies. The shipments of weapons from the European Union have slowed, but its leaders have stood by Ukraine despite the pains of a growing energy crisis caused by the war. The top E.U. executive official, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed measures to ease the spiraling prices, and said in a speech on Wednesday that sanctions on Russia would remain in place. Image A Russian tank with the ""Z"" symbol was abandoned in a square with a Soviet-era monument in Izium on Wednesday. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times ""This is a war on our energy, a war on our economy, a war on our values and a war on our future,"" she told E.U. lawmakers in Strasbourg, France. Ukrainian forces were pressing the advantage on Wednesday, fighting on the outskirts of Lyman, according to Ukrainian officials. The city, near the Russian-occupied province of Luhansk, could serve as a launching point for advances east. But military analysts say the Ukrainians rapid advance comes with a risk of stretching lines too thin, which could expose reclaimed towns to Russian attacks. Despite its problems with manpower and organization, Russia still has a significant advantage over Ukraine in supplies and ammunition. And as Russian forces establish new defensive positions, front lines could freeze into a bloody stalemate that saps Ukraines strength through the winter. Russia has also shown a willingness to strike civilian targets far from the front. Hours after Mr. Zelenskys visit, a salvo of cruise missiles slammed into the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, the presidents hometown, where, residents said, a dam was damaged. In Izium, where soldiers patrolled eerily deserted streets and explosions rang out every hour or so as Ukrainian soldiers cleared land mines, the city seemed only in the early stages of returning to normal. Russian graffiti still sprawled on a sign leading into town proclaimed ""New Moscow"" beside an abandoned Russian tank and green boxes of ammunition. Of the towns prewar population, about 40,000, about a quarter remained during the occupation. Image Passing abandoned Russian military vehicles near Izium on Wednesday. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times Officials on the high-level visit with the president wasted no opportunity to thumb their noses at the Russian Armys pell-mell departure. ""The Russian were defeated here, and they fled in a shameful way,"" Hanna Maylar, a deputy minister of defense, said in an interview. But, she added, intense fighting continues in other areas. ""Most of Kharkiv region is liberated, but the Russians still have a plan to conquer Ukraine."" The Kharkiv offensive, and in particular the move into Izium, was a significant setback for Russias war effort. By threatening a flank of Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region, the offensive has all but ruled out a secure Russian takeover of the Donbas, military analysts say. The region became central to Russias military objectives after the failed attack on Kyiv, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cited it among his justifications for the invasion in February. He asserted that Russian troops had been deployed to protect Russian speakers in the Donbas against the Ukrainian government, which the Kremlin has falsely claimed is full of ""Nazis."" But Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian deputy minister of interior, said the collapse in Russian morale was perhaps a greater achievement of the counterattack than regained territory. ""Russia already lost,"" he said. ""They destroyed the myth themselves. For 20 years, they built up stories that 'our army is the strongest. And then it turns out not to be so.""

But despite growing calls from Russian nationalists for a full-scale draft, a spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Tuesday that mobilization was ""not being discussed at the moment."" For residents in Izium, where damp fall leaves littered the asphalt, the Russians swift departure was as much a surprise for them as the Russians who had occupied the city for nearly seven months. Over all, as Russia has fallen back from the northeast, Ukrainian forces have taken back an area that is home to about 150,000 people in 300 cities, towns and villages. Image A Ukrainian soldier in front of a destroyed apartment block in Izium on Wednesday. Credit... Nicole Tung for The New York Times Yevhen Yenin, a deputy minister of internal affairs in Ukraine, said the police had found 10 bodies in and around the nearby town of Balakliya, indicating the Russian Army had committed human rights abuses. So far, soldiers have stumbled on no scene as macabre as the streets of Bucha, a Kyiv suburb where the bodies of about 450 civilians were left behind by retreating Russian troops. ""The work is just beginning"" in the northeast, Mr. Yenin said, adding that it was ""too early to tell"" the extent of abuses. The regional police in Kharkiv said in a statement on Wednesday that they had confirmed the death by torture of one person in a police station used by Russian forces to detain civilians in Balakliya. A former detainee told reporters on Tuesday he had been subjected to electrical shocks. The Russian government has dismissed witness accounts, photographs, videos and other evidence of atrocities by its soldiers in Bucha, and has denied accusations against its forces. Residents of newly reclaimed communities have said that the Ukrainian authorities were interrogating some people and searching for collaborators, and that civilians had died in the Ukrainian counterattack on their communities.

[],Armed Russian Soldiers Oversee Referendum Voting,,"Witnesses and Ukrainian officials described intimidating scenes in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine where what Western officials have called ""sham"" referendums are taking place. Protests against Putins mobilization policy continue across Russia.","Image An armed Russian serviceman stood guard over an outdoor polling station in Luhansk, Ukraine, as voters participated in a referendum to join Russia on Saturday. Credit... Stringer/EPA, via Shutterstock KYIV, Ukraine -- Much of the population of occupied areas have fled. And mail-in and electronic voting is ostensibly taking place despite the lack of a postal service or even electricity in many towns. But another aspect of what Moscows proxies are calling referendums to join Russia casts particular doubt on the process: voting in the presence of armed soldiers, according to witnesses and Ukrainian officials. ""The so-called referendum is more like an opinion poll under the muzzle of machine guns,"" Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the eastern Luhansk region, wrote on Telegram on Saturday. Residents have described an intimidating scene: soldiers with balaclavas covering their faces accompanying poll workers going house-to-house with ballots. The soldiers stand by as the ballots are filled in, leaving little doubt over which box they expect to be checked. ""How can they say voting is voluntary when they came with guns?"" Natalia, a resident of a village in Kherson region who, like others interviewed for this article, declined to give her name for fear of reprisal, said in a telephone interview Saturday. Villagers came out to greet the small delegation of two soldiers and three women with a ballot box, she said. Natalia said she asked the soldiers why they were there, and they told her that they were guarding the women. Then she turned to the women. ""I asked, 'What are you so afraid of that you need to be guarded?"" Natalia said. ""They were silent."" In the city of Kherson, soldiers and poll workers approached pedestrians on the sidewalk of a central avenue, Perekopska Street, and asked them to vote, paying no heed to electoral rolls or identification documents, a resident, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Serhiy, said in a telephone interview. Russian proxies hastily called the referendums in four Ukrainian regions -- Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizka and Kherson -- after the Ukrainian army expelled Russian forces from most of a fifth, Kharkiv, in a stunning counteroffensive earlier this month. Ukrainian and Western officials have said flatly that they would ignore the results of what they consider to be ""sham"" referendums. They believe that President Vladimir V. Putins aim is to ultimately annex those parts of Ukraine -- as Russia did with the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- and then threaten severe responses if Ukraine continues military action on what the Kremlin will consider Russian land. Image Residents of Mariupol, Ukraine, filled out referendum ballots on a bench outside a destroyed building on Saturday. Credit... Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters Another suspected goal is to be able to conscript into the Russian army Ukrainians in occupied areas -- forcing them to fight their own countrymen in the war. Ukraines military headquarters said in a statement on Saturday that draft notices had already been handed out in the Zaporizka and Kherson regions of southern Ukraine. Much of the occupied territory where the referendums are taking place is cut off from internet and cellphone coverage, or in areas of active military combat -- making any independent assessment of ballot distribution or vote counting impossible. Russia claims foreign observers are present, though they do not appear to be from internationally recognized bodies. ""Electoral commissions accompanied by armed soldiers roam the region and continue to hunt voters,"" Yurii Sobolevskyi, the first deputy head of the Kherson Regional Council, wrote of the poll workers carrying ballots door-to-door. He said polling stations were empty. Two surveillance videos from the stairwells of apartment buildings in the Zaporizka region posted online on Saturday by the exiled Ukrainian mayor of the city of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, showed soldiers gripping guns, walking with women carrying clear plastic boxes of ballots. ""They are entering buildings with weapons,"" Mr. Orlyov said in a telephone interview. He said residents had recounted to him scenes of raw intimidation by soldiers. ""They bang loudly, they ring the doorbell, they give people a ballot and point with their rifle where to put the mark."" Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizka region, said Saturday that about three-quarters of the population had fled the area because of fighting, undermining any claim of a legitimate result. Mr. Starukh also emphasized the impact of armed Russian soldiers in managing the voting. ""It is not difficult to understand what mark people will put under the muzzles of automatic weapons,"" he wrote on Telegram.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/24/world/russia-ukraine-putin-news
[],Putin Frames Illegal Annexation as Part of Existential Battle With West,,"In Moscow, the Russian leader declares four Ukrainian regions part of his country, a widely denounced move. The U.S. and Britain ordered new sanctions on Russia in response.","Image President Vladimir V. Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow on Friday. Credit... Pool photo by Dmitry Astakhov President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday asserted that Russia would take control of four Ukrainian regions and decried the United States for ""Satanism"" in a speech that marked an escalation in Moscows war against Ukraine and positioned Russia, in starkly confrontational terms, as fighting an existential battle with Western elites he deemed ""the enemy."" Speaking to hundreds of Russian lawmakers and governors in a grand Kremlin hall, Mr. Putin said that the residents of the four regions -- which are still partially controlled by Ukrainian forces -- would become Russias citizens ""forever."" He then held a signing ceremony with the Russian-installed heads of those regions to start the official annexation process, before clasping hands with them and chanting ""Russia! Russia!"" Mr. Putins address came against a backdrop of Russian embarrassments on the battlefield, where Ukraines forces have scored stunning victories in recent weeks in the east. Even as the Russian leader spoke, officials said the Ukrainian army had moved closer to encircling the Russian-occupied town of Lyman, a strategically important hub in the Donetsk region that lies inside the territory Mr. Putin is claiming. Even by Mr. Putins increasingly antagonistic standards, the speech was extraordinary, a combination of bluster and menace that mixed conspiratorial riffs against the American-led ""neocolonial system"" with an appeal to the world to see Russia as the leader of an uprising against American power. He referred to ""the ruling circles of the so-called West"" as ""the enemy,"" a word he rarely uses in reference to the West -- and struck a tone of spiteful anger and defiance. ""Not only do Western elites deny national sovereignty and international law,"" he said in the 37-minute address. ""Their hegemony has a pronounced character of totalitarianism, despotism and apartheid."" Western leaders have condemned Russias annexations as illegal, and the ""referendums that preceded them -- purporting to show local support for joining Russia -- as fraudulent. The Biden administration announced new sanctions in response to the Kremlins move. President Biden was quick to denounce Mr. Putins actions to annex the four territories, saying they ""have no legitimacy and adding that ""the United States will always honor Ukraines internationally recognized borders. Ukraines government has rebuffed Mr. Putins claims and vowed to retake territory captured by Russia in the east and south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Mr. Putins speech on Friday by announcing that he was fast-tracking his countrys application to the NATO alliance. In a video, he accused the Kremlin of trying to ""steal something that does not belong to it."" ""Ukraine will not allow that,"" he said. Mr. Putin insisted that Russias position on annexing the four territories was nonnegotiable, adding that the country would defend them ""with all the forces and means at our disposal."" ""I call on the Kyiv regime to immediately cease fire and all military action,"" he said, and for the Ukrainian government ""to return to the negotiating table."" ""But we will not discuss the decision of the people of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson,"" he went on, referring to the four Ukrainian regions being annexed. ""It has been made. Russia will not betray it."" Mr. Putin cast the conflict with the West in even more severe terms than in previous speeches, reeling off centuries of Western military actions to denounce the American-led world order as fundamentally evil, corrupt and set on Russias destruction. ""The repression of freedom is taking on the outlines of a 'reverse religion, of real Satanism,"" Mr. Putin said, asserting that liberal Western values on matters like gender identity amounted to a ""denial of man."" But Mr. Putin offered few new details on the matter that is now perhaps of greatest concern in Western capitals -- whether, and at what point, he may be prepared to use weapons of mass destruction to force Ukraine to capitulate. His spokesman said earlier in the day that after the annexation of the four regions -- a move that virtually no other country is expected to recognize -- an attack on those regions would be treated as an attack on Russia. Without saying so directly, Mr. Putin hinted that the role of nuclear weapons in war is on his mind. Describing the West as ""deceitful and hypocritical through and through,"" Mr. Putin noted that the United States was the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war. He then added: ""By the way, they created a precedent."" Valerie Hopkins and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/09/30/world/russia-ukraine-war-news

Russian missiles continued to strike civilian targets, raising the death count from a four-day barrage to more than three dozen.","Image A gas terminal on Thursday in Obergailbach in eastern France. France has for the first time started directly sending natural gas to Germany. Credit... Jean-Francois Badias/Associated Press PARIS -- France began pumping natural gas directly to Germany for the first time on Thursday, part of a landmark agreement struck by both governments to help each other confront Europes energy crisis as Russia cuts off gas supplies to Europe. Volumes of gas capable of producing around 31 gigawatt-hours per day of electricity began flowing early on Thursday into Germany, the French network operator GRTgaz said. The connection has a maximum capacity of 100 gigawatt-hours per day, equal to the power output of four nuclear reactors, or about 10 percent of the amount of liquefied natural gas that France imports each day, the company said. GRTgaz said that months ago it had begun modifying its pipeline networks to be able to send gas to Germany. For years, the German economy had relied on Russian gas exports, but Moscow slashed them this year in response to Western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. France gets its gas from the Netherlands, Norway and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency, although supplies from Russia were cut off in September. It also receives deliveries of liquefied natural gas from several L.N.G. terminals. To face the energy crunch, France has been storing gas and getting more of it from its European partners and Qatar. Recently, President Emmanuel Macron has burnished relations with Algeria, a former French colony, which has agreed to sharply increase gas exports to France. In exchange for the gas from France, Germany has pledged to export more electricity to that country as it grapples with an unprecedented crisis in its nuclear power industry that has reduced power production. ""Germany needs our gas, and we need the electricity produced in the rest of Europe, and in particular in Germany,"" Mr. Macron said last month after speaking with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about the agreement. ""We will contribute to European solidarity in gas and benefit from European solidarity in electricity."" ""Merci beaucoup,"" Klaus Muller, the head of Germanys federal network agency, wrote in a Twitter message to GRTgaz on Thursday. ""The gas deliveries from France, through Saarland, help Germanys energy security."" European countries have pledged to work together to get through winter as Russias aggression in Ukraine raises the prospect of a prolonged energy crisis. On Thursday, Spain proposed increasing its gas deliveries to France by 18 percent in the coming months, Spains ecological transition minister, Teresa Ribera, said. As Europes largest economy and the one most dependent on Russian gas, Germany has been among the countries worst affected by the energy crisis rippling across Europe, where natural gas costs about 10 times what it did a year ago. Both Berlin and Paris have imposed a broad range of conservation measures, including lowering thermostats and hot water heaters, encouraging the use of public transport and requiring public buildings to turn off lights early. The energy crunch has forced European governments to fall back on less-desirable power sources that they had been trying to phase out in a push to go green. Germany, for instance, has decided to keep coal-fired power plants online and restart several others that had been mothballed. In addition, Germany decided to keep two of its three remaining nuclear power plants operational as an emergency reserve for its electricity supply, breaking a political taboo and delaying its plans to become the first industrial power to go nuclear-free for its energy. And in France, the government is facing an energy crisis of its own after half its fleet of nuclear power plants -- the largest in Europe -- was taken offline this year for inspections and repairs. The electricity shortage has driven prices to record levels, forcing factories to cut production and put tens of thousands of employees on furlough. Bruno Le Maire, Frances economy minister, warned Thursday that high energy prices continued to pose a ""major risk"" to French industry and would lead to a 10 percent decline in industrial production this winter. Berlin this month announced a 200 billion-euro (about $196 billion) aid plan for German households, businesses and industries. It includes policies to curb natural gas and electricity prices domestically. And France has already spent around EUR100 billion since last winter doing the same. But with Mr. Scholz facing pushback over his governments decision to keep nuclear plants running, Germanys ability to uphold its end of the energy-swap deal with France may wind up depending on the French themselves: GRTgaz said the exported French gas would allow Germany to produce more electricity, which in turn would be sent back to the French grid during peak hours. ""If we did not have European solidarity,"" Mr. Macron said in a televised interview on Wednesday, ""we would have serious problems.""",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/13/world/russia-ukraine-war-news

Much of this work happens outside Ukraine, at bases in Germany, France and Britain, for example. But even as the Biden administration has declared it will not deploy American troops to Ukraine, some C.I.A. personnel have continued to operate in the country secretly, mostly in the capital, Kyiv, directing much of the vast amounts of intelligence the United States is sharing with Ukrainian forces, according to current and former officials. At the same time, a few dozen commandos from other NATO countries, including Britain, France, Canada and Lithuania, also have been working inside Ukraine. The United States withdrew its own 150 military instructors before the war began in February, but commandos from these allies either remained or have gone in and out of the country since then, training and advising Ukrainian troops and providing an on-the-ground conduit for weapons and other aid, three U.S. officials said. Few other details have emerged about what the C.I.A. personnel or the commandos are doing, but their presence in the country -- on top of the diplomatic staff members who returned after Russia gave up its siege of Kyiv -- hints at the scale of the secretive effort to assist Ukraine that is underway and the risks that Washington and its allies are taking.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/politics/commandos-russia-ukraine.html

['Chris Massaro'],Could high energy prices erode European support for Ukraine war effort?,2022-10-13 07:51:49,"As Ukrainian forces increase pressure on Russia, President Vladimir Putin looks to sow cracks within European and NATO unity. Energy prices may hurt Ukraine's cause.","Russias war in Ukraine is having a profound impact across Europe as energy prices soar and an anticipated cold winter draws near. That pain is reportedly being felt hard in the Czech Republic, an eastern European country that is particularly sensitive to Russian aggression and has been very supportive of Ukrainian resistance. Yet some observers fear the realities of confronting Russia and forcefully backing Kyiv are setting in among the population. ""It will be a difficult winter ahead for centrist European governments, and its important that Europe is able to maintain solidarity to combat the energy and cost-of-living crisis amid Russias weaponization of energy,"" Paddy Ryan, assistant director of European energy security at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital. Late last month, thousands took to the streets in Pragues Wenceslas Square to voice opposition to the Czech Republics handling of the energy crisis stoked by the war in Ukraine. Angry protesters called for the resignation of Prime Minister Petr Fiala and his western-oriented coalition government. The protests included an overlap of the far right and far left, a strong indicator of the angst mounting as winter approaches. EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS, CITIZENS GEAR UP FOR WORSENING ENERGY CRISIS Russias invasion of Ukraine is central to the recent turmoil roiling Czech politics. Many of the protesters are demanding the resignation of the prime minister and blame the government for joining the rest of the European Union and NATO in implementing harsh economic sanctions on Russia. Protesters claim attempts by the government to alleviate the pain are inadequate. This is not the first time the government has faced stiff opposition over the growing energy crisis. In early September, Fiala's ruling coalition narrowly survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence, showing that peoples disaffection with the high price of electricity and natural gas will remain a potent political issue. UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ACCUSES RUSSIA OF 'PREPARING FOR A DECISIVE ENERGY ATTACK ON ALL EUROPEANS' THIS WINTER While protesters may blame their government for the high price of energy and overall inflation, Russian President Vladimir Putins coercive decision to cut gas supplies to Europe is a major factor in the skyrocketing prices. ""The Kremlin is coupling this overt energy warfare against the E.U. with its disinformation tactics attempting to amplify these concerns among European electorates, where Moscow's objective is to sow division and dissent across Europe in an effort to get Western capitals to drop their support for Ukraine, especially as the Russian military continues to suffer defeats on the battlefield,"" Benjamin L. Schmitt, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Fox News Digital. PUTIN'S RUSSIA CREATED EUROPE'S WORST REFUGEE CRISIS Russias wartime decision to cut gas to Europe caused one of the worst energy crises in recent memory. The Czech Republic, as well as many other nations in Eastern Europe, rely almost exclusively on Russia for its natural gas. The E.U. got 39.2% of its natural gas from Russia in 2021. The Czech Republic consumes around 9.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas each year, most of which comes from Russia. A complete shutdown of gas by Russia could reduce GDP by 6% in the most vulnerable E.U. countries, according to an estimate from the International Monetary Fund. Putins weaponization of energy at a critical moment just before winter aims to create market uncertainty and drive up prices to poke holes in the western alliance. E.U. leaders remind the public that high energy costs are a result of Putins war of aggression in Ukraine and exacerbated by pandemic-related supply chain issues. The move by Putin, despite the warnings, appears to have worked in some respects as the demonstrations in the Czech Republic show. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The high cost of energy is not the only issue Czech citizens must grapple with. The influx of refugees, over 400,000 Ukrainians have entered the Czech Republic since the war began on Feb. 24, adds to the frustrations felt by Czechs over their government's perceived inability to address basic life necessities.

Much of the world has been stunned - and gratified - by the unexpected success of the Ukrainian military against Russian President Vladimir Putins aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his countrymen have reminded us that heart and courage can sometimes change a battlefield in unexpected ways. And though Ukraines forces couldnt have achieved this success without Western military and intelligence support - especially from the U.S., as our friends in Europe once again fell short of their commitments - Ukrainians have shown great courage. This courage has forced a fresh evaluation of the Russian threat in Europe, for which we should all be grateful. But now, with Congress passing an additional $12 billion in Ukraine aid, I believe the time has come to ask a series of critical questions. What is Americas strategy in Ukraine? What is our goal? Can we achieve that goal without pushing Putin to use, in his own words, ""all available means"" at his disposal? PUTIN ORDERS RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAKE OVER UKRAINE'S ZAPORIZHZHIA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT FOLLOWING ANNEXATION Our commander in chief has yet to answer any of these questions. I believe its irresponsible to spend $12 billion - and a cumulative total of at least $54 billion - to fund an effort that has no defined end. I have proudly backed every effort to support the freedom-loving people of Ukraine, and Im proud of Americas significant role in their success against Putin. But the landscape of this war is not what it was two months ago, let alone when Russian boots first stepped on Ukrainian soil. That demands a change in strategy, or, at the very least, the clarification of our strategy. The New York Times Editorial Board - a voice that is rarely and reluctantly critical of President Joe Biden - wrote in May about our $40 billion emergency aid package to Ukraine and the likelihood that Russia would threaten to use nuclear weapons. ""These are extraordinary costs and serious dangers,"" the editorial board wrote. ""And yet there are many questions that President Biden has yet to answer for the American public with regard to the continued involvement of the United States in this conflict."" Fast forward five months, when the costs are higher and the dangers even more serious. Still, these pressing questions for Biden remain unanswered. Zelenskyy recently said that Ukraine would recapture Crimea by any means necessary. But its important to note that Crimea - which has been recognized by Russia as part of Russia since 2014 - has far more historical and cultural ties to Russia than it does to Ukraine. Putin would undoubtedly view offensive action in Crimea as an act of war in Russian territory. Do we share that goal with Zelenskyy? If so, Biden needs to explain to the American people why its necessary to commit tens of billions more in direct economic and military assistance. More, he needs to brace the American people for a long and bloody affair in which its not just possible, but likely that we will see direct American and NATO involvement. Putin simply will not lose Crimea without expanding the war. If the American people appear reluctant to make such a commitment, maybe its because were still dealing with the consequences of a long, costly conflict in Afghanistan during which, under this presidents leadership, we experienced one of the most humiliating withdrawals in American history. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Or is our goal to help Ukraine recapture its pre-February territory? If so, we must recognize two realities. First, even this more limited goal will prove to be a long and violent undertaking. And second, a protracted effort to expel all Russian forces from Eastern Ukraine will still increase the likelihood of the U.S. being drawn into direct conflict with Russia. Putins reign - and ego - can survive a botched war, but not an utter humiliation by Zelenskyy and the United States. Were already seeing signs of his desperation, as he recently mobilized an additional 300,000 troops and made another nuclear threat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Its clear that his escalation is a sign of weakness, not strength. But an animal is most dangerous when its injured and backed into a corner - his threats must be taken seriously. The bottom line, though, is that Americas role in this war is far too ambiguous. There has been too much time passed and money spent for our mission to remain unclear. For Biden to leave so many questions unanswered - and for Congress to approve billions of additional taxpayer dollars while they remain unanswered - is a disservice to the people of both Ukraine and the United States.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/congress-cant-keep-funding-ukraine-forever-without-biden-telling-us-his-strategy-to-end-war

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy filmed a video in Kyiv minutes after the missiles stopped, declaring that ""we are dealing with terrorists."" Widespread power and water outages were reported in Kyiv and elsewhere following the attack, though Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko stated the city was intentionally shutting down some supply for repairs.

We begin with Trey. He's on the ground there, as I mentioned, in Kharkiv, for us, the target of some of those attacks. What is the latest from there, Trey? TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sandra, good afternoon. We are getting new reaction today to the Russian attack on Ukraine earlier that decimated this country in many cities. Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, calling this a -- quote -- ""unacceptable escalation of the war.""

At least 11 people were killed and dozens more injured, including the head of the national police cyber unit in Kyiv. Black plumes of smoke were seen rising from the city center of the Ukrainian capital after the attack began.

SMITH: Trey Yingst on the ground there for us. Trey, thank you. President Biden, meanwhile, condemning the Russian airstrikes, while vowing to support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. To Mark Meredith now. He's at the White House. He's got the latest from there for us. Hi, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Sandra, good afternoon to you. As you mentioned, the president is condemning Russia's latest actions. He says the attacks in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities are only the latest sign of the utter brutality, which is being carried out by the Russian military. The president did not stop to speak to reporters when leaving Delaware this afternoon. He just got back to the White House a few minutes ago as well. But, as Trey mentioned, he also has spoken by phone today with Ukraine's president, President Zelenskyy saying that they did discuss air defenses. In his own statement today, the president said the Russian airstrikes serve no military purpose and were meant to kill civilians. President Biden going on to say -- quote -- ""These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom."" Tomorrow, G7 leaders are expected to hold a conference call with Ukraine's president to discuss the war, President Biden saying the U.S. is going to continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance.

Over the weekend, top White House aides insisted there are no signs that Russia has changed its nuclear posture -- Sandra. SMITH: Mark Meredith live in Washington for us, not at the White House, at this hour. But, Mark, we thank you. How should the U.S. respond to Russian President Vladimir Putin's latest attacks on Ukraine? Former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg joins us now. How would you define this moment in this war, General? Good to see you. LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG (RET.), FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, thanks, Sandra. Thanks for having me on today. Look, in any war, war is a province of risk and opportunity. And there's an opportunity right now. It does come with risk. What President Biden should do -- and he shouldn't be doing it over the airwaves or a DNC fund-raiser, I think. He needs to pick up the phone and needs to call Vladimir Putin and say quite clearly to him, look, we are going all in. We are going to provide Ukraine with every bit of armament they need to defeat the Russian army in the field and force them out of the field. And that means Crimea as well. And then you turn it over to Putin and said, OK, it's over to you now. What are you going to do? I understand the risk behind that. But we haven't done that. As I said earlier, we haven't given the armament he needs. We haven't given him the air defense that he needs. Give it to him. Press the attack going forward. Then you basically tell Putin, it's up to you now. Do you want to escalate or do you want to negotiate? And if you escalate, we're prepared for that. If you want to negotiate, we're prepared -- prepared for that as well. But we haven't done that. And I think we have not helped the Ukrainians win this fight as much as we should. And the opportunity is there. And we should follow that. SMITH: So, you agree with Secretary Pompeo that it took us a while to get there, but now that the strategy is in place, we need more and we need sooner to get to Ukraine, so they can continue to defend themselves. As far as these Russian attacks on these many Ukrainian cities, as Trey Yingst was just reporting, that this is widely seen as an escalation of this war, what do you believe is going to have to happen next? I mean, you have got this major attack on the bridge there connecting Russia to Crimea. KELLOGG: Yes. SMITH: Vladimir Putin labeling that as what he sees as a terror attack. Where does this go next, General? KELLOGG: Yes, Sandra, Putin has misread this fight from the very, very start. He thinks, by going after civilian targets, it's going to break the will of the Ukrainian people. It's not. They're going to be more resolved in the fight going forward. So, he's attacking targets that he thinks is going to affect the will and they're going to break down -- bring down the government. That's not going to happen. He's losing the fight in the field. And what Zelenskyy needs to do, but he needs our help to do it -- he needs the alliance help as well -- to press the attack forward. And I really look -- and I have said this before -- look at the south. If that attack on Kherson keeps going the way it's going and he's able to cut off Crimea, and he's able to take Crimea -- and the reason they hit the Kerch Bridge was that is a supply route into Crimea -- then Putin has got a major problem. But escalate to a level that Putin has to make the decision, do I escalate more or do I negotiate? And then there his problem escalation is, he's going to become a pariah among the United Nations. But all of his allies are going to desert him as well. I just cannot believe the Russian military, nor the siloviki, the strongmen within Russia, or the Chinese want him to escalate much further than he is right now. You're going to see the Chinese walk away from him. And when that happens, he's a man alone. SMITH: I have only got about 30 seconds left or so, General. But I just wanted to get a final thought from you on this. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, condemned the attack as unacceptable, the Russian strikes, that is, calling it a demonstration of weakness by Putin, not strength. It seems to me you agree with that statement. KELLOGG: Well, I do, but we need to follow up on that. We can't just have rhetoric. You got to give them something with -- beyond the rhetoric. And that is weaponry. They need to prosecute the attack going forward. We haven't given the air defense system. We haven't given him ATACMS. Give him everything he needs. But we need to tell Putin, there are certain guardrails and we're coming to do this and we're going to defeat -- the Ukrainians are going to defeat the Russian army in the field. And if you don't want that, then you better negotiate or pull them out. SMITH: General Keith Kellogg, great to see you, and thank you for joining us. KELLOGG: Thanks, Sandra. SMITH: All right, Vice President Kamala Harris making the midterm rounds in Texas over the weekend. But guess where the administration's border czar did not go?

Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry saw this coming. He will be with us shortly. But Kelly O'Grady is out in Los Angeles. She's hearing about a new blame game for those rising prices. What are you hearing, Kelly? KELLY O'GRADY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, Governor Gavin Newsom has been trying to put the blame on oil companies. Coming up next, we will tell you why. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Hitting the road is starting to hit you in the wallet again, gas prices up for 16 straight days now, and lawmakers already pointing fingers at the oil companies. We will talk with former Energy Secretary Rick Perry about that in just a moment, but first to Kelly O'Grady. She is in Los Angeles for us with the latest round of pain at the pump. What's happening now, Kelly? ' O'GRADY: Hey, good to see you, Sandra. Yes, I mean, of course, people across the country are feeling it, but nowhere more so than California. And you can see it is $6.49 here for a gallon of regular. But, like you said, right, we have been seeing gas prices rise for the last 16 days. Now, the national average, it's $3.91 today, close to $4 a gallon. That's already 12 cents higher than a week ago. And I want to highlight it's 63 percent higher than when the president took office. And that could get worse, largely because of OPEC's planned production cut of two million barrels per day. Many, of course, are calling that announcement a slap in the face, after the president visited Saudi Arabia. Prices, oil prices have cooled a bit today, but we are still seeing double-digit growth because of that vs. a week ago. And one path the administration is considering, to continue tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, not only is it a short-term solution, but those reserves, of course, are intended to be used for disasters like Hurricane Ian, and are now at their lowest low levels in 40 years. I do want to draw attention to what's going on with diesel prices, because we have now gone over the $5-a-gallon mark, 19 cents higher than a week ago. So that pain that you're feeling is not just going to be when you go fill up your car, but diesel is known as the canary for inflation. And that's because it gets our groceries and our holiday presents to the store. So this week's inflation number that I know we're all eagerly awaiting won't include the increase at the pump that we're seeing now. But come November, come December, we will start to see the impact of that. And, certainly, if inflation goes up, we will also see the Fed continue to likely get aggressive with rates. So it's kind of just this snowballing domino effect that we're seeing in numbers like that at the pump, Sandra. SMITH: Thank you very much, Kelly O'Grady, on rising prices at the pump. Our next guest is not a fan of what the White House is doing when it comes to the pump. In a new FOXNews.com op-ed, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry is writing in part -- quote -- ""Biden's war on American energy has him begging foreign countries for oil, instead of drilling here."" Rick Perry joins us now. Very good to see you, sir. Thanks for joining us on this. Everybody wants those prices to come down. It inflicts a lot of pain on the American consumer. American small businesses are reeling because of this as well. So what is your take? Is this the administration's fault, why we continue to see sky-high gas and oil prices? FMR. GOV. RICK PERRY (R-TX): Yes, well, happy Columbus Day, Sandra. And it's a privilege to be with you under, let's say, austere conditions in the country because of policies that this administration has been involved with, particularly the oil and gas industry. They started sending a message on day one, we're going to try to bring the fossil fuel industry to its knees. And they basically are doing a pretty good job of that. They're overtaxing, over-regulating, overlitigating. And if you want less of something, that's how you do it. You go in and government overtaxes, over-regulates, overlitigates. And that's what this Biden administration is doing, shutting down pipelines, not allowing the offshore drilling, not allowing federal leases. All of that collectively sends a message to the companies, whether they're small independents or whether they're the big oil and gas companies, that you better be really careful if you're going to go expend monies to explore for and deliver oil to the refineries. And, as a matter of fact, I think we're about a million barrels last refining in the U.S. since the Biden administration took over. So, all of that together, Sandra, sends a clear message that a lot of this recession that's happening is driven by the cost of energy. And America was independent for the first time in 67 years in 2019 because of the policies that President Trump put into place. We were producing. We were doing a great job. We were working with our foreign partners. And the supply of energy around the world was in a lot better place. Europe is going to pay a huge price for their decisions about doing away with fossil fuels this coming... SMITH: So, let me ask you about how we can fix this problem, because, I mean, this question needs to be put to Republicans who could regain control of the House and/or the Senate in the fall. So, they're promising they can bring those prices down. What do you do about it? If that refining capacity is offline to the degree that you just described, and there's solid evidence of that, well, does pumping more help or buying oil help or releasing more from the reserves help, if we can't refine it into gasoline? PERRY: Well, and I think sending messages -- if you want more of something, you incentivize it. It's that simple. This governing is not rocket science. And so the point is, when the Republicans come into place, they need to use every tool that they have to be able to send the message to the fossil fuel industry, and also at the same time -- and this is a little longer-range process, but send the message to the small modular reactor industry out there that is -- has the potential to really do some good things. It's going to take a while for that technology to get into place, but it'll be faster than you realize. SMITH: Yes. PERRY: So, fossil fuels, small modular reactors, those together can send the message around the world that America is going to get back into the energy business in a big way. SMITH: Secretary, final question for you. There seems to be still blame putting on the oil companies themselves, even some -- in some cases, the mom-and-pop gas stations in this country, and warnings to them not to price-gouge. You heard it from the president during the storm, in the aftermath of the storm. You hear it from Gavin Newsom out there in California. And in my research today, I was surprised to see a White House pool report from you several years ago, 2017, I believe, and you too, during Tropical Storm Harvey, made a similar warning to not price-gouge at the fuel pumps in the wake of the storm. PERRY: Yes. SMITH: Why put those warnings out there, if there's not a lot of evidence that that's actually happening? Have you seen that happening? What rendered that warning then? Because we're getting a lot more of those now. PERRY: And during hurricanes, we always send that message out there that, if you're thinking about, just because of the supply and demand issue, this is not the time to do it. And I think it's always been, from my perspective, a message that gets sent during hurricanes. But that's not what this administration is doing. This administration is doing it to try to cover up for bad policies that they put into place. There is no doubt that this administration wants to force Americans to quit using fossil fuels and go to wind and solar to power their grid. And it's just not going to happen. You have got to have fossil fuels and nuclear power to be the baseload for your electric grids. And this administration would rather play politics and blame everybody in the world, instead of looking in the mirror and going, you know what? We were wrong. Just stand up and say... SMITH: Well, it's the lower-income, hardworking Americans who are paying the price for it. That is for sure. And those prices are on the way back up oil, closing above $90 a barrel yet again today. Secretary, great to see you. Thank you very much for coming on the program today. PERRY: Thank you, Sandra. Good to be with you. SMITH: All right. How will gas prices heading higher impact voters heading to the polls? Our panel will debate. Plus, the rainbow fentanyl scare hitting right before Halloween. Aishah Hasnie on what lawmakers are doing about it. And why a top Obama economic adviser is now saying a recession is more and more likely. Steve Moore on that coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Containing the border crisis. They were used to plug gaps in the border wall in Yuma. Now meet the sheriff looking forward to you seeing them in his area. And see more on the recession warnings that are ramping up from some interesting figures -- when we return. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Four weeks from tomorrow, you will help decide which party controls Congress. And with gas prices spiking and inflation remaining a top concern for Americans, are Democrats worrying? Let's get the read from Democratic strategist Ari Aramesh and Hadley Heath Manning for the Independent Women's Forum. Thanks so much to both of you for joining us. Ari, I will start with you first. How worried is your party or how worried should your party be? ARI ARAMESH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I am worried. I think the California Democratic Party is worried, although California is doing pretty well in terms of its population voting Democratic pretty steady. But, in general, national Democrats, especially on -- in certain House races, because Senate, as you know, it's very different. It's a different ball game. We don't have gerrymandering. But, in certain House races, especially given how narrowly divided the House is -- it only takes very few seats for Kevin McCarthy to become speaker. Gas prices going up hits everybody in their pocketbooks. It hits the middle class, the working class, and even -- unless you're making billions, when you're pumping gas -- and I pumped while I was driving to LAX a couple of nights ago, and I saw $7.21 or $7.29 a gallon... SMITH: Wow. ARAMESH: ... which is unheard of. But, again, it's around Beverly hills, and then on the way to LAX right off the Howard Hughes Highway, and that's more towards Inglewood going to LAX. So you don't have an option. You got to pump gas. Having said that, let's back up a bit. The trajectory of Democrats losing a ton of seats, sort of 1994 style, that's about -- that's sort of forgotten at this point. I think we're going to do a pretty good job in the Senate. Thank you to -- thanks to Republicans for running such poor-quality candidates, from Pennsylvania, to Ohio, to Georgia. SMITH: Well, let's get Hadley in here. ARAMESH: But when it comes down to the House, it's a little different. What's that? SMITH: All right, so, Hadley, feel free to respond to directly to Ari on that. HADLEY HEATH MANNING, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, look, if the voters of this country vote on the issues, then Democrats are in trouble, because, in terms of what the biggest issues are, inflation, the economy, energy, gas prices, those are issues where Americans are looking for a change in leadership. They're dissatisfied with the way things have been going. President Biden made the decision to drain millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and that temporarily decreased gas prices. But now they're coming back up. I think, if he was looking for the political solution, the Band-Aid for this problem, he probably pulled the trigger on that decision too early. But Americans want long-term solutions. They want to know that they're not going to keep paying record high levels of inflation for groceries, for gas and so forth. And so, if voters vote those issues, Democrats are in trouble. If they vote the candidates, that's another question. It's always a challenge for both parties to get the right people out there, the right messages out there. But, certainly, in terms of the issues, the American people are more in agreement with the GOP right now. SMITH: Ari, it's pretty hard not to tie this president to the high prices that everyone's experiencing today. And in the wake of those high prices that we're arguably -- and Republicans are making the point -- they were avoidable in the first place. But this administration seemed to turn a blind eye to inflation. But why do you believe this White House hasn't gone out of its way to show voters that, no matter whose fault it is, that they're going to rein in those high prices, and they're going to start pumping more oil domestically to bring down your gas prices if, in poll after poll, it shows up as the number one concern of the American voter, no matter your party? ARAMESH: So, two big issues. If people are going to vote candidates and persons, oh, boy, we have got a huge advantage over Herschel Walker and Dr. Oz and that fellow J.D. Vance in Ohio, character-wise, personality-wise, and candidate-wise. Let's come down to oil. And this -- and it bothers me. It's really rich, actually, to hear from Trump supporters who convinced MBS -- that's the crown prince of Saudi Arabia -- or at least are in a meeting of mind with him. This is the Saudi Arabian government, one of the largest, if not the largest, OPEC producers, to side with the Russians, and decrease oil production, OPEC oil production, to keep oil prices high. Now, if you're a U.S. ally, you do what helps us right now against Iran and against Russia. (CROSSTALK) SMITH: So, you're blaming OPEC for the high oil prices. Hadley, go ahead. ARAMESH: These are Jared Kushner's buddies. (CROSSTALK) SMITH: You have gotten a lot of time, Ari. (CROSSTALK) ARAMESH: These are Jared's bedfellows. HEATH MANNING: There's going to inherent insecurity for Americans and anyone else who puts our oil and gas and energy future in the hands of international bad actors. That's the problem in the first place. ARAMESH: Jared Kushner. HEATH MANNING: We need to focus on American domestic oil and gas energy production. That gives us not only a break when it comes to the gas pump in our pocketbooks, but that changes the equation in terms of our national security, in terms of international politics. We need to be independent of some of these relationships that Ari is talking about. We need to be able to say that we are secure in our energy future and our energy prosperity. SMITH: Well, hey, look... HEATH MANNING: And the only way we're going to do that is here at home. SMITH: And this debate was pretty much only about inflation. We haven't even gotten into the border crisis and crime in this country that is running rampant as well, two big issues also that Republicans are trying to bring home to their voters as best how to handle that. Thank you to both of you. Appreciate the conversation, as we are now just - - I guess we're under 40 days out from Election Day. Hard to believe. Thanks. Thank you to you both. No border stop for the border czar. Vice President Kamala Harris taking a trip to Texas to raise money, and that has lawmakers there raising eyebrows. To Griff Jenkins on that. GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Sandra. The border surge showing no signs of slowing down, more than 10,000 migrants in the first 10 days of this fiscal year, and they're coming from a lot for the Central America. We have got that story when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: No border stop for the border czar. Texas Republican Tony Gonzales slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for not visiting the border on her trip to his state over the weekend. FOX News correspondent Griff Jenkins is live there in Eagle Pass, Texas, with more for us. Hello, Griff. JENKINS: Hey, Sandra. Good afternoon. And it's worth pointing out that Vice President Harris last visited the border last June when she went to a processing center in El Paso. She's never been here, Sandra, and seeing this. Let me take you up to our FOX sky drone and show you what you can see here. This is ground zero for migrant encounters, last fiscal year, more than 470,000 to the Del Rio Sector. And the migrants are coming from more than 40 countries right now. Over the weekend, some 13,000 migrants across the entire Southwest border from as far away as Somalia, Syria and Iran. Now, let me show you some video of some drone we shot this morning Sandra. This is a group of about 100 or so at a pecan orchard. They come every morning around the same time at daylight with the efficiency of having perhaps your Amazon package delivered. The Border Patrol, National Guard, and Texas DPS wait for them, process them, and send them along their way. It's a daily occurrence like clockwork. I want to show you. Take a look at this video we shot with our drone on Sunday, though. This is the large groups we're getting, upwards of 200. In this one, there were 178 total; 21 were children, among them, a woman from Cuba, Sandra, that I asked how much she had paid a coyote to cross the river. She said $1,500. This is all a part of what Congressman Gonzales really wants Vice President Harris to see and why he's so frustrated that she won't come and see it. Here's a little bit of what Representative Gonzales had to say. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): She doesn't have to visit me. I'm a Republican. I get that. But guess what? Henry Cuellar is a Democrat. Vicente Gonzalez is a Democrat. Veronica Escobar is a Democrat. She could visit anywhere along the border. The fact is, they have put their head in the sand. They have abandoned -- they have abandoned us along the border. (END VIDEO CLIP) JENKINS: And the other thing that she would see is the human smuggling that cartels are profiting on so much. In the 10 days since I have been here, October 1, when the new fiscal year began, in just this area, they have thwarted 10 smuggling attempts. That, of course, doesn't include the ones we don't know about that successfully may have gotten through -- Sandra, send it back to you. SMITH: Griff Jenkins, yes. Griff, thank you very much for your reporting on all of that. Now to a sheriff who is dealing with this crisis firsthand, Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels. Sheriff, thank you very much for joining us. It's hard to imagine why the vice president, the border czar, in the middle of a border crisis, wouldn't make a stop there to see what is happening firsthand. MARK DANNELS, COCHISE COUNTY, ARIZONA, SHERIFF: Well, good afternoon, Sandra. And I agree 100 percent. The impacts these border communities, to include my own, is facing is nothing but negative, totally negative when it comes to public safety, national security, or humanitarian. You look at the five million that have breached our border, the million got-aways, 1,000 that died on U.S. soil. And then you look at respect -- like in my county. We're pushing 1,000 people been booked in my rural county jail for border-related crimes. These are state violations that have been booked in my jail. And I can't get this president, this vice president or leadership in Congress to engage us, recognize us, or even act upon it. It is a complete insult. And I agree with the congressman. We have been left abandoned down here. SMITH: Wow. That's a huge statement. I mean, engage with us. Work with us. To that point, how much contact have you had with this White House on this issue? DANNELS: Sandra, I will just say that this is the first president that has failed to meet with sheriffs, our National Sheriffs Association. We have invited them. They have failed to meet with us. It's like we don't even exist. (AUDIO GAP) four weeks ago to a conference here on the border with sheriffs from all over the country. Not even an answer that we can't make it. They just totally ignore us, first sheriff in history -- first president in history not to meet with this country's sheriffs. SMITH: Wow. Just give us a sense of what your communities are dealing with there, Sheriff. DANNELS: Well, right now, we're putting containers on the border, thanks to our governor, trying to secure our border. We deal with pursuits every day. We deal with crimes every day as a result of this border. We have 100 percent got-aways in our county on the southeast corner of the state that I deal with. I think we lead the nation, the Tucson Sector, which we're part of, when it comes to smuggling by the cartels, drugs. You name it, we're seeing it here on the border. And it's nothing positive. It's destroying the quality of life that we should be addressing here on the border that we're being neglected upon. This border is a reality for this country, not just for the 31 border counties. American needs to stand up and unite when it comes to our border in this country. SMITH: So, Sheriff, we have been showing images of containers lining up, getting ready to put them in place, some already in place, getting hauled in. To your point about that effort, when you do this, what are you seeing is the actual impact of that? Are they working? DANNELS: Well, they're still going in place. I know they have already installed them and stacked them in Yuma County, Arizona. Talking to the sheriff out there, he says it's making a difference and slowing them down. And it sends a message that, absent the federal government, our state governor, our sheriffs in the state that are engaged, that we're going to do everything we can to protect our citizens and, most important, our state in this country. So, shame on the federal government not being a partner with us on this, because that federal border is their responsibility, not the state and locals. But we're doing their job. And we will continue to do it to protect our country. SMITH: Well, Sheriff, we certainly sense the urgency in your voice. If you had the ear of this White House, if they did reach out to communicate, which you said they have not yet, what would be your first request? What would be the biggest resource that you need today, Sheriff? DANNELS: We need a message. We need a message from this president that the border is going to be secured and there will be consequences for violating our laws in the country. Those that come across our country illegally will be addressed properly. And we also need them to engage with us. Every -- right now, we have none. And as long as they stay absent to this, the problem is only going to get worse in Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and all other states in this country. It is not a positive thing. We got to have a president that cares about Americans, that wants to protect us all, as his oath of office states and mine does too. SMITH: To that point, this is no longer just affecting those border communities. It is all over the country experiencing the vast number of people that continue to flow over that border. Sheriff, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. Appreciate your time, sir. DANNELS: Thank you, Sandra. SMITH: All right. And thanks to the sheriff. With 29 days to go, the border a top issue on the ballot for Arizona border voters. FOX News correspondent Rich Edson is reporting on that for us. He's got the latest details. Hello, Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Good afternoon, Sandra. Apprehensions along the Southern border have hit a record high. Migrant encounters are up significantly over the prior year in the Arizona border sectors of Yuma and Tucson. That's according to the latest data from Customs and Border Protection. In the middle of that, major campaigns in Arizona for governor and U.S. Senate. Republican Kari Lake says, if she wins the governor's race, she will use state power to administer federal immigration laws. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R), ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I will issue a declaration of invasion and we will work to stop these narco-terrorists from human trafficking and drug trafficking into Arizona. (END VIDEO CLIP) EDSON: Former President Trump held a rally last night for Lake and other Republicans running in the state. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs spoke with reporters. She says Lake is spreading conspiracies about the 2020 election. She's also blamed Trump and her own party for the state of the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATIE HOBBS (D), ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE: Trump centered his whole immigration policy around finishing the wall. And it's not done. And -- but Biden does need to step up immigration and border security. (END VIDEO CLIP) EDSON: Hobbs also called Lake's plan to declare an invasion empty rhetoric that will bring chaos to Arizona. In Arizona's Senate race, a FOX News poll late last month shows voters found the most important issues in that race as border security, the preservation of American democracy, inflation, and abortion. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is trying to defend his seat against Republican challenger Blake Masters. Kelly has broken with Biden, called the border chaos and a mess, and that the administration changing border rules was dumb. Masters called Kelly a rubber stamp for Biden's agenda -- back to you, Sandra. SMITH: Rich Edson reporting on that for us. Rich, thank you. And as parents get ready to take their kids out trick or treating this house Halloween, they are getting a warning from Republican senators: Check what is inside your kids' candy bags. FOX's Aishah Hasnie on Capitol Hill with more on that for us. Hey, Aishah. AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Sandra. And you know what? That warning, well, some are now calling that a scare tactic just about 20 days ahead of the midterm elections. But we talked with one mom who has gone through tragedy not once, but twice, and she will -- she's going to tell us all why it's not a scare tactic. That's coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Republican senators are sounding the alarm over the dangers of rainbow fentanyl, as kids across America get ready to trick or treat this Halloween. To Aishah Hasnie now. She's on Capitol Hill with that for us. Hi, Aishah. HASNIE: Hi there, Sandra. That's right. So about 12 GOP senators have put out this PSA really warning parents out there to be on the lookout for this candy-colored fentanyl, extremely dangerous, especially to kids, as they are now being targeted. They have issued this dire warning. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): The powerful drug cartels are coming after your kids, your neighbors, your students, your family members and your friends. SEN. STEVE DAINES (R-MT): Even just handling these pills or powders masquerading as candy can kill a person. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: So, the senators say, Mexican drug cartels are targeting kids with not only fentanyl that looks like candy, but also fentanyl powder that's disguised to look like sidewalk chalk. Now, some in the mainstream media have called the ad a scare tactic, pointing out that Halloween lands just about a week before the midterm election. But it also comes less than a month after a bipartisan group of attorneys general sent a letter to President Biden calling on him to classify fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction. Again, these are Democrats and Republicans. And they wrote this: ""Enough fentanyl has been seized in the last year to kill every man, woman and child in the United States several times over."" It's scary. One woman who lost her son to a drug overdose back in 2018 and then her 13-year-old cousin to fentanyl last year says this is no scare tactic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEBI NADLER, CO-FOUNDER, MOMS AGAINST DRUGS: It is not a scare tactic. What are the chances of it happening? Who knows at this point. We're in a new world with the drugs. We are losing 10-year-old kids, people experimenting for the first time. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: And so that is why we're hearing from these families of victims that are saying, Sandra, talk to your kids. Don't worry about how young they are. Really sit down and have an open, honest conversation with them just to make them aware that just one pill in this situation can kill them -- Sandra. SMITH: Aishah Hasnie on a really important story for the country. Thank you very much. HASNIE: You bet. SMITH: And coming up, the recession warning from a top name in the Obama era and one of the top CEOs in America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Next time you dine out, you might want to be on the lookout for a new sneaky trend, restaurants reportedly serving up airline-style fees on some bills to avoid raising prices. FOX Business' Susan Li has more on that story for us. Hello, Susan. SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so call it fee-flation or call it drip pricing. If you have eaten out at a restaurant or hailed a ride or even looked at your credit card statements lately, you may have noticed a few extra added charges. And customers have complained that restaurant bills, food delivery, ride sharing, and credit card statements are much more expensive these days. And that's because, instead of outright raising prices to cover higher costs, businesses are charging you a little more in added fees to cover rising inflation and wages, probably most notable on your restaurant check, with restaurants accused of serving up those airline-style fees, where your final bill might actually be 30 to 40 percent higher if you add up the 20 percent mandatory tips, the extra percentage charges on top for health care taxes to cover workers, state sales taxes, even wellness fees or macroeconomic surcharges, as restaurants cover perks to attract workers. Now, we know that inflation is still near 40-year highs. The jobs market is still tight, with restaurants and hospitality adding workers last month. And prices are forecast to jump another 8 percent-plus from last year in September. And that data due out on Thursday morning. And, Sandra, that's a slight cooldown from August, but, still, as you know, historically high. SMITH: All right, Susan Li on that story for us. Thank you, Susan. Former Obama economic adviser Larry Summers now saying a recession is more likely than not in the next 18 months. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon echoing that very same point today. Joining us now to discuss is economist Steve Moore. I suppose, if you're making that prediction or that forecast, Steve, then you would be someone who is not in the camp that we are already in a recession. I mean, by most traditional definitions, economists say a couple straight quarters of negative GDP, you're in a recession, which we have. But, anyway, I digress. STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Yes. SMITH: There are some serious warnings out there nonetheless. MOORE: There are. And when I heard those two economists -- well, Jamie Dimon and Larry Summers, say that, I'm like, what do you think we're living in right now? I mean, come on. Over the last nine months, the economy has contracted. But it's not just the loss of GDP. The average family has lost about $4,000 in purchasing power over the last year. You have seen $10 trillion of losses in the stock market this year. Employers are having the hardest time getting people back to work. I mean, I could just go on with these litany of problems. You got gas prices, Sandra, that now look like they're headed back to $4.50 to $5 a gallon. And so, yes, we're in a recession right now. And what they're saying was, maybe we will have one a year from now. Come on, it's here. SMITH: You know, you can't blame these restaurants either, right? They don't want to take the blame for raising prices. They don't want you to sit down at their restaurant and see that their prices went up and their customers to say, hey, what are you doing here? They want to clearly show that this is what we are passing down to you. We're keeping our prices the same as we -- the best that they can, at least, but we're going to show you what we would otherwise be passing along to raise prices. They don't want the blame for it. MOORE: Well, this is such an important point you're making, Sandra, because the Biden administration's response to all of these higher prices and this crummy economy is to blame, oh, the oil companies, the gas stations, the restaurants for all the -- the drug companies for raising their prices. And all of them are saying exactly what you just said, Sandra. Wait a minute. We have got higher costs because energy is more expensive. Food is more expensive. Wood is more expensive. Construction is more expensive. So it all gets passed on to the consumers. We're getting crushed, as I mentioned, $4,000 a year in lost income. That's like a $300-a-month pay cut for people. And then people said, well, we're not really in a recession right now. It is a cost of living recession. And it's hitting the poor and the middle class the hardest. SMITH: There's a lot of different ways consumers are paying for this, Americans are paying for this, living paycheck to paycheck, 60 percent of the country, more Americans working two full-time jobs -- full-time jobs to pay for inflation.

There were no immediate reports of casualties. The blasts came hours after Russia concentrated attacks in its increasingly troubled invasion of Ukraine on areas it illegally annexed, while the death toll from earlier missile strikes on apartment buildings in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia rose to 14. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the early-morning explosions were the result of missile strikes in the center of the city. He said that the blasts sparked fires at one of the city's medical institutions and a nonresidential building. ZELENSKYY INTERVIEW: RUSSIA HAS BEGUN TO 'PREPARE THEIR SOCIETY' FOR POSSIBLE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS In a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his conduct of Europe's worst armed conflict since World War II, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to human rights organizations in his country and Ukraine, and to an activist jailed in Russia's ally Belarus. Berit Reiss-Andersen, the committee's chair, said the honor went to ""three outstanding champions of human rights, democracy and peaceful coexistence."" Putin this week illegally claimed four regions of Ukraine as Russian territory, including the Zaporizhzhia region that is home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, whose reactors were shut down last month. Fighting near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has alarmed the U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog, which on Friday doubled to four the number of its inspectors monitoring plant safeguards. An accident there could release 10 times more potentially lethal radiation than the worlds worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in Ukraine 36 years ago, Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister Ruslan Strilets said Friday. ""The situation with the occupation, shelling, and mining of the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants by Russian troops is causing consequences that will have a global character,"" Strilets told The Associated Press. The U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported more trouble at the plant, saying Friday on Twitter that external power had again been cut off to one of Zaporizhzhia's shutdown reactors, necessitating the use of emergency backup diesel generators to run safety systems. The city of Zaporizhzhia is located 53 kilometers (33 miles) away from the nuclear plant as a crow flies and remains under Ukrainian control. To cement Russia's claim to the region, Russian forces bombarded the city with S-300 missiles on Thursday, with more attacks reported Friday. Ukrainian authorities said the death toll from the strikes on apartment buildings rose to 14 on Friday, while 12 people wounded in the bombardment remained hospitalized. AS PUTIN TURNS 70, FORMER RUSSIA INSIDER WEIGHS IN ON LIKELIHOOD OF NUCLEAR MOVE Missiles also struck the city overnight, wounding one person, Zaporizhzhia Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said. Russia also used Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones there for the first time and damaged two infrastructure facilities, he said. With its army losing ground to a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south and east, Russia has deployed unmanned, disposable Iranian-made drones that are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but still can damage ground targets. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Russia's use of the explosives-packed drones was unlikely to affect the course of the war. ""They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate nonlinear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,"" analysts at the think tank wrote. In other Moscow-annexed areas, Russia's Defense Ministry reported Friday that its forces had repelled Ukrainian advances near the city of Lyman and retaken three villages elsewhere in the eastern Donetsk region. The ministry also claimed that Russian forces had prevented Ukrainian troops from advancing on several villages in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Friday that this week alone, his military has recaptured 776 square kilometers (300 square miles) of territory in the east and 29 settlements, including six in the Luhansk region, which Putin has annexed. In total, Ukrainian forces have liberated 2,434 square kilometers (940 square miles) of land and 96 settlements since the beginning of its counteroffensive, he said. In Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Russian troops shelled the city of Nikopol overnight, killing one person, wounding another and damaging buildings, natural gas pipelines and electricity systems, the governor reported. Nikopol lies along the Dnieper River across from Russian-held territory near the nuclear power plant. The city has been shelled frequently for weeks. The trail of Russias devastation and death from areas where its troops retreated became clearer Friday. A report by Ukrainian First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Yevhen Yenin revealed that 530 bodies of civilians have been found in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region since Sept. 7. The residents killed during the Russian occupation included 257 men, 225 women and 19 children, with 29 people unidentified, Yenin said. Most of the bodies were found in a previously disclosed mass grave in the city of Izium. UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR NATO TO LAUNCH 'PREEMPTIVE STRIKES' IN RUSSIA, SPOKESPERSON FORCED TO CLARIFY According to Yenin, the recovered bodies bore signs of gunshots, explosions and torture. Some people had ropes around their necks, hands tied behind their back, bullet wounds to their knees and broken ribs. Authorities have identified 22 torture sites in parts of the Kharkiv region that Ukrainian forces recently liberated, said Serhiy Bolvinov, a regional police official. In recently recaptured Lyman, workers found 200 individual graves and a mass grave with an unknown number of victims, Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko reported on Telegram. In Sviatohirsk, 24 kilometers (15 miles) from Lyman, 21 bodies of civilians were reburied. Russian military equipment and weapons, meanwhile, is getting into Ukrainian hands. Britains Ministry of Defense said Friday that Ukrainian forces have captured at least 440 tanks and about 650 armored vehicles since the Russian invasion started Feb. 24. ""The failure of Russian crews to destroy intact equipment before withdrawing or surrendering highlights their poor state of training and low levels of battle discipline,"" the British ministry said. ""With Russian formations under severe strain in several sectors and increasingly demoralized troops, Russia will likely continue to lose heavy weaponry."" Putin ordered a partial mobilization of Russian army reservists last month to reinforce manpower on the front lines in Ukraine. Mistakes have dogged the military call-up, however, and tens of thousands of men have fled Russia, unwilling to fight Putin's war. That has left Russia desperate for troop reinforcements. The Ukrainian military said Friday that 500 former criminals have been mobilized to reinforce Russian ranks in the eastern Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces have retaken territory. Law enforcement officers are commanding the new units, the military said. Russia's state news agency Tass reported Friday that a court in the Russian city of Penza had dismissed the first case against a Russian man called up to serve but who refused. The 32-year-old man's lawyers had argued that the law under which he was charged applies only to conscription evaders, not those subject to the partial mobilization.

Biden must wake up.","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The war in Ukraine has revealed how the digital age is leveling the playing field between great powers and smaller countries. Ukraine has skillfully deployed precision munitions, drone technology and sophisticated encrypted software to gain the upper hand against Russias invading conventional military, but Russian President Vladimir Putins most recent remarks, and his move to illegally annex portions of Ukraine, make it clear that digital warfare will also unleash a second nuclear age. Western technology, including encrypted command and control, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), drone and counter-drone systems, combined with Ukrainian savvy and resolve have arrested Russian advances and recently rolled back Russian gains. Chips and software have proven more potent than tanks and soldiers. ""The lesson for every big country is 'holy s---,"" Palantir CEO Alex Karp recently told CNBC. Pushed back toward his own borders and facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat, Putin is now threatening the unthinkable. ""If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened,"" he warned, ""we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people."" BIDEN INVOKES POSSIBILITY OF 'ARMAGEDDON' IN DEMOCRATIC FUNDRAISER SPEECH Putin has rattled his nuclear saber before. But this time is different. This time hes losing a war, and the calculation is as simple as it is alarming: Software beats steel, but nuclear weapons beat all. Technologists have feared this outcome. As the war unfolded, prominent U.S. tech entrepreneurs traveled to Ukraine to witness firsthand how a digital military can defeat a conventional power. They understand more than anyone that the war we are seeing involves capabilities and concepts that until now were relegated to think-tank papers, war-game simulations and military proving grounds. The system that for eight decades prevented nuclear war is no longer the system in which armies operate. Warfare of the 21st Century is being determined less by the size of an army and more by the speed and efficiency of what experts call the kill chain: the network of software-driven systems that enable the military to understand threats rapidly, identify targets and strike the adversary using satellites, autonomous systems and artificial intelligence. In its fight against Russia, Ukraine has cobbled together the superior kill chain. But Karp and others observed that the longer the conflict, the more desperate Putin becomes, the more likely it is that nuclear weapons will enter the battlefield. And Putin is desperate, now resorting to calling up 300,000 reservists, prompting many Russians to purchase one-way tickets out of the country. This was all foreseeable, yet military planners and nuclear strategists have not adequately prepared. Rather than adopting a nuclear posture and developing capabilities that could deter an adversary from escalating to a nuclear strike, the Biden administration remains stuck in the immediate post-Cold War mindset that prioritized arms control negotiations and hesitated to develop new battlefield nuclear weapons. The Trump administration attempted to get ahead of this problem by exiting the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Russia had already abrogated its treaty obligations, and China -- not a party to the Cold War era treaty -- has been moving forward building a sophisticated tactical nuclear arsenal, leaving the United States at a dangerous disadvantage by tying its own hands. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Additionally, plans to add nuclear-capable cruise missiles to our military arsenal have been stymied by some who view any development of nuclear weapons as a threat to peace rather than a necessary tool to keep the peace. Alarmingly, some in the Biden administration pushed for the United States to depart from its current declaratory policy and instead adopt a ""no first use"" policy -- declaring to the world that the United States would never take the first shot, no matter how grave the threat. If adopted, this policy would remove our nuclear arsenals deterrent effects. A no-first-use policy would weaken the United States and its allies before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine this past winter. But now, such a move would be seen as an invitation to Russia to launch a nuclear strike on Ukraine.

This scenario will arise again when a digital military stymies another revanchist nuclear power. Putin is betting the West may fear a new era of nuclear brinksmanship more than a Russian-occupied Ukraine.

When the Russians invaded Ukraine, one of their first priorities was to bomb police stations and to empty prisons. When I visited Ukraine August with Stephen Komorek and other members of the ULET Working Group, which supports humanitarian aid and helping law enforcement in Ukraine, I found myself wondering why. We asked General Andriy Nebytov of the Kyiv Regional Police about this tactic while visiting his Kyiv headquarters, and he explained, ""A demoralized population is easier for the invader to control. Attacking the ability of the police to protect people was a carefully planned operation, and they knew what they were doing."" And what exactly was that? They were conducting a psychological operation (PSYOP) aimed at undermining the morale of the Ukrainian people. A PSYOP is a form of military operation that targets the emotional and mental state of the enemy. By degrading the polices ability to serve and protect, the Russians sought to make the war-traumatized Ukrainians feel even less safe and destroy their will to resist.

Instead, I discovered how the Ukrainians have shown resistance in 100 small ways. For the Ukrainians, this ordeal has lasted eight months thus far, and Russians have actively worked to intensify the trauma of their invasion. When, on top of the military violence, criminals can freely loot, rape, and join forces with the enemy, the Ukrainians distress multiplies and takes on many forms. Even when towns are liberated, the invaders still work to undermine morale. As Nebytov told me, ""The invaders left in a hurry, but even so, they took the time to boobytrap houses. A woman might open her refrigerator and end up detonating a mine."" They even target children, going so far as to attach ""tiny explosives to children's toys."" He explained, ""The mini-bombs dont kill the children, but kids who played with these needed to have their hands amputated."" Pavel Maraev, a Ukrainian social worker, gave me a glimpse of the compounding stress his fellow Ukrainians are enduring. ""People who are worried about being killed in a rocket attack, or whove lost loved ones, or whose home is now a pile of rubble -- those people are traumatized,"" he said. Given this widespread tragedy, he stated, ""We think as many as one-third of the population has some degree of PTSD."" Though the Russians have created unimaginable conditions, they have failed to destroy the Ukrainians will to resist. Known for his work on the sociology of fear, Professor Frank Furedi offered insight into the Ukrainians unwavering morale. A day after leaving Ukraine, I met Furedi in England for lunch, where he told me a remarkable story about a Nazi death camp inmate. During World War II, this prisoner was starving to death, yet he saved breadcrumbs to feed a wild bird that visited him in his cell each day. Years later, the former prisoner said that having the bird in his life fortified his will to live. Furedi told me this story for a reason: I had shared with him how almost all of the women that I met in Ukraine, whether in stores, restaurants, public parks, offices or police stations, were wearing beautiful, bright nail polish. The brave Ukrainian women, like the prisoner who fed the wild bird, will not let their spirits be crushed. By creating even small moments of reprieve, they are defeating the Russian attempts to demoralize their people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER While visiting a bombed-out police training center near the Belarus border, I found another example of this resiliency of spirit. Today, six months after the bombing, the smoky remains of the training center resemble a fire-and-brimstone hellscape. However, 20 yards from the building, theres a rose garden with a dozen waist-high bushes in full bloom. Their scent wafts through the air. In the midst of death and destruction, the police still tend to this beautiful garden. The Ukrainian people havent given into despair: instead, they have created moments of beauty. These small acts help maintain a semblance of normalcy in their lives and serve as a reminder of what theyre fighting for, and why they can never give up. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP No one knows how long this war is going to last, but Im certain that Putins efforts to destroy law enforcement and, in doing so, demoralize the people of Ukraine, havent worked. Like the starving prisoner who survived because of the beauty of a wild bird, the Ukrainian people show the tenacity of their spirit. With their beautiful painted nails and rose gardens, they resist Putins PSYOP in countless ways.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukrainians-strengthen-resolve-against-russian-invasion-small-acts-resistance-beauty

It was purchased by Ukranian celebrity Andriy Danylko, Out Magazine reported. Danylko has not publicly discussed the auction, but had refused to leave Kyiv and often speaks in support of the country's defiance against the Russian invasion. The car is now being put up for auction to raise money for victims of the Ukraine war, with the proceeds being donated to the Superhuman Center, which is a medical program in Lviv supported by a Richard Branson, Sting and others, that is focused on providing prosthetic, reconstructive and post-traumatic stress disorder treatment to victims of the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined the G7 nations in a Tuesday meeting in which Zelenskyy proposed a ""peace formula"" to help staunch Russias brutal attacks. Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked nations like the U.S. to provide better air defense systems and on Tuesday called on all seven nations to assist Kyiv in finding funding for an ""air shield."" The G7 joint statement did not comment on Zelenskyys requests but instead vowed to continue supporting Ukraine as Russias assault continues. ""We reassured President Zelenskyy that we are undeterred and steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement read. ""We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

Allied with the troubled call-up of hundreds of thousands of troops, every new development helped fuel a sense of panic in Russia. In a tacit acknowledgment that the war was not going according to plan, Putin named an overall commander for his forces in Ukraine for the first time over the weekend, a man known for brutality. Surgei Surovikin, nicknamed ""General Armageddon"" and known for his merciless air campaign in Syria, was appointed the same day the bridge connecting Russia with annexed Crimea was severely damaged in a blast that dealt Putin a strategic and symbolic blow. Putin said Mondays deadly strikes were revenge; Kyiv claimed they had been planned well in advance. Either way, they offered a further sign of the growing influence of hard-line voices as the war enters a decisive period with Russian troops on the retreat. On Wednesday, Ukraine claimed to have regained even more ground in the south, liberating five villages in the strategic Kherson region after a sudden breakthrough there this month. ""Putin has been persuaded to switch to a more aggressive line,"" Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the independent R.Politik think tank and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in an analysis post on the Telegram messaging app. He ""is becoming a hostage of this situation, and if he hesitates next time, it may cause genuine annoyance on the part of those who are now invested in the war till a victorious end,"" Stanovaya said. Putin and Col. Gen. Sergei Surovikin at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow in December 2017. Alexei Druzhinin / Sputnik via AP file The pro-war figures followed their celebration with a push for Putin to keep up the intensity. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, one of the most outspoken proponents of the war, declared after he praised Mondays strikes: ""There will be others."" The Russian-installed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, suggested that if Russia had conducted such strikes against energy and water supplies from the start of the war, Kyiv would have fallen months ago. He also expressed hope that ""the pace of the operation will not slow down."" Anton Krasovsky, a propagandist TV host and ardent war supporter, called for similar strikes ""every day"" so ""every Russian can see that we are winning."" Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who led the backlash against Russias military chiefs for battlefield failures this month, said he was ""now 100% satisfied"" with how the war was going, reminding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that ""Russia hasnt really started yet."" But while the deadly attacks may have boosted some in Russia, they seemed unlikely to change the dynamic on the battlefield in a significant way. ""The attacks have not degraded Ukrainian military capabilities and are fundamentally irrelevant to the fighting in the northeast and south of Ukraine,"" said Tuck of Kings College. Strikes have continued against civilian targets since Monday, but with nowhere near the same intensity. Sustaining such attacks will require a constant supply of rockets, which Moscow is increasingly running out of, military analysts said. Already, Kyiv says, Russia has been using more ""kamikaze"" drones, procured from Iran, as a cheaper and more dispensable alternative. Russia seems to have the capability of short pulses of long-range missile fire, Tuck said, ""but given what we know already about the Russian willingness to accept the infliction of civilian casualties, if they could sustain this form of attack for any length of time, then they would already have implemented such a campaign.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-putin-strikes-crimea-bridge-explosion-strikes-rcna51612

Kyivs troops were pushing forward in the countrys east and south, threatening a major new breakthrough and forcing Putin's soldiers to retreat from territory he claimed to have annexed in a grand ceremony last week. Moscow has matched its annexation claims with a call-up of reservists and new nuclear threats, a broad intervention that has not only threatened to escalate its clash with Ukraines Western allies, but also expose domestic vulnerabilities. Russian lawmakers Monday ratified the illegal annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian regions: Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. But while the Kremlin said it had not yet determined where the borders for its newly claimed land would be established, the areas under its control were being rapidly pushed back. Advances in the south and east Moscow said its troops abandoned Lyman over the weekend to avoid encirclement, with Western officials and observers hailing Ukraine's recapture of the city in the eastern Donetsk region as a significant development that could pave the way for further advances. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said his military had retaken two settlements in the southern Kherson region. ""The successes of our soldiers are not limited to Lyman,"" he said in a statement on Telegram on Sunday. That was the first official sign of significant Ukrainian gains in the south, where Russia concentrated the majority of its forces to repel a long-touted counteroffensive -- opening itself up to the surprise push in the northeast that has turned the tide of the war. After weeks of slow progress and relentless artillery fire in the south, Ukraine seemed to be surging forward there as well. ""Superior enemy tank units succeeded in wedging into the depth of our defense,"" Russia's Defense Ministry said in an update on Telegram. ""The information is tense, lets put it that way, because, yes there were indeed breakthroughs,"" Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in occupied parts of Kherson, told Russian state television, according to Reuters. ""Theres a settlement called Dudchany, right along the Dnieper River, and right there, in that region, there was a (Ukrainian) breakthrough,"" he said. That would represent a major forward thrust of about 20 miles, threatening thousands of Russian troops on the west bank of the river. Meanwhile, retaking Lyman allowed Ukrainian forces to advance into the neighboring Luhansk region. Kyiv's troops ""managed to cross the administrative border of the LPR and gain a foothold in the direction of the settlement of Lysychansk,"" said Andrii Marochko, a Russian-installed official in the self-proclaimed breakaway ""Luhansk People's Republic."" Lysychansk is a key city that Russia seized after weeks of grinding battles earlier in the year. Russian unease Ukraines successes despite Russias proclaimed annexation have added to mounting pressure on Putin, with voices usually supportive of the Kremlin criticizing Russia's performance in the war. ""The Russian defeat in Kharkiv Oblast and Lyman, combined with the Kremlins failure to conduct partial mobilization effectively and fairly are fundamentally changing the Russian information space,"" the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest update. The discussion of the conflict ""has significantly deviated from the narratives preferred by the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) that things are generally under control,"" the U.S.-based military think thank added. The country's state media has reflected the increasingly pessimistic tone. ""For a certain period of time, things wont be easy for us. We shouldnt be expecting good news right now,"" Vladimir Solovyov, the most prominent presenter on state TV, said Sunday. Dmitry Sablin, a senior lawmaker, said on Solovyov's show that Russian forces needed to ""stop and regroup"" and were facing all sorts of shortages. While Putin's proclaimed annexation was celebrated at patriotic rallies in Russia and the areas it occupies, the domestic mood has turned less positive. AP Nationalist Russian military bloggers have turned in recent days to criticizing the direction of the war, with many reporting on the latest battlefield setbacks. ""When this many Russian channels are sounding the alarm, it usually means theyre in trouble,"" Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think tank, said on Twitter. Putin has sought to boost his ailing forces by calling up hundreds of thousands of men, a partial mobilization that has been marked by chaotic conscription efforts and an exodus of many fleeing the draft. Around half of the soldiers conscripted in one region of Russia's far east were sent home after being deemed unfit to serve in the army, the local governor announced Monday. The military commissar of the region was also removed from his position, Khabarovsk Gov. Mikahil Degtyarev said in a statement on his Telegram channel.

In a further sign of uncertainty, it remained unclear exactly what land Russia claimed to be annexing in Ukraine's east and south. ""We will continue to consult with the population of these regions on the borders,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday in response to a question on the subject. Putin has vowed to use ""all available means"" to defend the territory he was co-opting, an implied threat of nuclear war to defend his fragile grip on the annexed territory.

The move was made ""in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,"" the ministry said, referring to the industrial heartland in Ukraine's east that became the focal point of the Kremlin's war after it was forced to give up on its assault on the capital, Kyiv. The ministry had earlier shared video showing military vehicles that it said were rushing to the aid of its forces in the east. Russian military vehicles in Ukraine drive in the direction of Kharkiv in video released by the Russian Defense Ministry Friday.

""The very fact of the breakthrough is a significant victory for them,"" Vitaly Ganchev, who leads the Kremlin-controlled government in the occupied territory in Kharkiv province, said Friday in an appearance on Russian state TV. Russian President Vladimir Putin promised earlier this week to push on with Moscow's military efforts in Ukraine, saying that his country was gaining rather than losing from the conflict. Events on the battlefield appeared to paint a bleak picture for the Kremlin, however. Ukraine initially launched a counteroffensive in the countrys south late last month after weeks of public buildup and preparation, as it aimed to push toward the crucial coastal city of Kherson. Then this week, after Russia redeployed large numbers of its own forces to the south to combat that effort, reports began to emerge of Kyivs forces launching another counteroffensive farther north -- a move that appeared to catch both the broader world and Moscows military off guard. ""Either the Russians were too incompetent to see it, or they were so incompetent they saw it and couldnt do anything,"" Phillips OBrien, chairman of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said earlier this week. ""And neither of those are comforting for them."" Some Western military analysts said the advance appeared aimed at shutting off supply and communication lines Russia has relied on to sustain its forces in eastern Ukraine, and could potentially leave thousands of Russian troops encircled. Such sweeping advances on either side largely unheard of in a grinding, attritional conflict. Ukrainian soldiers on an armored vehicle in Kharkiv, on Sept. 9, 2022.

For instance, had Ukraine beaten back Russian forces or were they ""driving into fresh air?"" ""In other words, there's nobody there,"" he said, adding that he wanted to know if Ukraine was laying down strong supply lines and artillery support as it moved forward. A Reuters journalist inside a vast area recaptured by the advancing Ukrainian forces in recent days saw burned-out vehicles bearing the ""Z"" symbol of Moscows invasion, and boxes of ammunition lying in heaps at positions abandoned by fleeing Russian soldiers. The United States had expressed cautious optimism about Ukraines counteroffensive, with the Pentagon saying Kyivs forces were putting Western-supplied weapons to good use. ""We see success in Kherson now, we see some success in Kharkiv and so that is very, very encouraging,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a news conference Friday during a visit to Prague. Sasha Baker, deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, told reporters in Washington it was ""probably too soon to have a definitive assessment"" but added that ""I think weve seen some encouraging signs.""

Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that Ukraine was taking advantage of the Western-made weapons now in its arsenal, including U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems. President Joe Biden this week approved an additional $675 million in military aid for Ukraine, including more artillery ammunition, armored vehicles and anti-tank systems. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels after Blinken's trip to Kyiv, said the war was ""entering a critical phase,"" requiring the West to remain clear eyed about what's at stake.

['The Associated Press'],Heavy fighting rages in Ukraine's Russian-occupied south,2022-08-30 16:59:44,A surge in fighting on the southern front line and a Ukrainian claim of attacks on Russian positions fed speculation that an expected counteroffensive had begun.,"KYIV, Ukraine -- A surge in fighting on the southern front line and a Ukrainian claim of new attacks on Russian positions fed speculation Tuesday that a long-expected counteroffensive has started to try to turn the tide of the war. But Ukrainian officials warned against excessive optimism in a war that has seen similar expectations of changing fortunes before, and the Russian defense ministry claimed an attempt by Ukraines troops to launch an offensive had failed and caused heavy casualties. Even though independent verification of battlefield moves has been extremely tough, the British defense ministry said in an intelligence report that, as of early Monday, ""several brigades of the Ukrainian Armed Forces increased the weight of artillery fires in front line sectors across southern Ukraine."" Attention centered on potential damage Ukraine might have inflicted on Russian positions around the port city of Kherson, a major economic hub close to the Black Sea and one of Moscows prized possessions since it started the invasion just over half a year ago. A Ukrainian soldier hands his rifle to his comrades close to the front line in Mykolaiv oblast in southern Ukraine. Alex Chan / Sipa USA via AP Ukraines presidential office reported Tuesday that ""powerful explosions continued during the day and night in the Kherson region. Tough battles are ongoing practically across all"" of the strategic area. Ukrainian forces, the report said, have destroyed a number of ammunition depots in the region and all large bridges across the Dnieper River that are vital to bring supplies to the Russian troops. The Russian state news agency Tass reported five explosions rocking Kherson on Tuesday morning -- blasts likely caused by air defense systems at work. The Ukrainian militarys Operation Command South also reported destroying a pontoon crossing the Dnieper that the Russian forces were setting up and hitting a dozen command posts in several areas of the Kherson region with artillery fire. ""The most important thing is Ukrainian artillerys work on the bridges, which the Russian military can no longer use,"" Ukrainian independent military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. ""Even the barges have been destroyed. The Russians cant sustain forces near Kherson -- this is the most important."" On Monday, the southern command centers Nataliya Gumenyuik told the Ukrainian news outlet Liga.Net that Kyivs forces have launched offensive operations ""in many directions in our area of responsibility and have breached the enemys first line of defense."" The statement quickly made headlines after weeks of reports that Ukraine forces were preparing an offensive there and as Ukrainian attacks on the Kherson region intensified. Zhdanov said that Russia has three lines of defense in the Kherson region and that breaching the first one signals only ""isolated offensive actions by the Ukrainian army."" The war has ground to a stalemate over the past months with casualties rising and the local population bearing the brunt of suffering during relentless shelling in the east and also in the wider area around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has also been at the heart of fighting in Ukraine. Amid fears the plant could be damaged, leading to a radioactive leak, a U.N. nuclear watchdog team has arrived in Kyiv and is further preparing a mission to safeguard the Russian-occupied plant from nuclear catastrophe. The stakes couldnt be higher for the International Atomic Energy Agency experts, who will visit the plant in a country where the 1986 Chernobyl disaster spewed radiation throughout the region, shocking the world and intensifying a global push away from nuclear energy. Compounding an already complicated task is the inability of both sides in the war to agree on much beyond allowing the team to go there. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the wider region around the nuclear power plant, Europes largest, time and again. Nikopol, which is just across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia plant, once again came under a barrage of heavy shelling, local authorities said, with a bus station, stores and a childrens library sustaining damage. And the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, about 30 miles away, was targeted by a Russian missile strike, the Ukraine presidential office said. The dangers of a leak are now so high that officials have begun handing out anti-radiation iodine tablets to nearby residents. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to speculation in his nightly video address Monday, about whether his forces had launched a major counteroffensive. ""Anyone want to know what our plans are? You wont hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war."" From the other side, the Moscow-appointed regional leader of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, dismissed the Ukrainian assertion of an offensive in the Kherson region as false. He said Ukrainian forces have suffered big losses in the area. And for its part, the Russian defense ministry said its forces had inflicted heavy personnel and military equipment losses on Ukrainian troops. The Kherson region is just north of the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 to set off a conflict that was largely frozen until the Feb. 24 invasion.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-counteroffensive-putin-zelenskyy-crimea-rcna45477
"['Anna Borshchevskaya', 'Anna Borshchevskaya Is A Senior Fellow At The Washington Institute For Near East Policy', 'Author Of']",Russia-Ukraine war sees Putin escalate for internal reasons,2022-09-24 14:26:20,"Russian President Vladimir Putins decision to greatly escalate his war on Ukraine -- his announcement Wednesday of a partial mobilization of reserves, four","Russian President Vladimir Putins decision to greatly escalate his war on Ukraine -- his announcement Wednesday of a partial mobilization of reserves, four sham referendums in partly occupied Ukrainian territories and a veiled nuclear threat -- reflects his desperation to reverse the advances Ukraine has made in recent weeks. That desperation is likely a result of internal pressure. Until now, Putin has bent over backward to avoid a formal mobilization of the armed forces through calling up former military members and recruiting fresh troops (although informally, the military might have begun to do that as early as April or May). Putin has almost certainly obfuscated to avoid domestic backlash. Russians often say to themselves at times of hardship, ""just so long as there is no war."" The phrase is a reference to the unhealed trauma of World War II. Putin knew a war would be unpopular and had kept all of his previous military interventions limited before the current invasion of Ukraine. For Putin, winning is the only option. Retreat or compromise is something a Western leader would think about; Russian leaders dont take off-ramps. Until now, Putin has tried to maintain the fiction that the scope of the operation and the scale of the losses were minimal. Only days after entering Ukraine in late February, the Kremlin warned of prison sentences of up to 15 years for calling it a ""war"" or an ""invasion."" As late as Sept. 13, after the recent Ukrainian counteroffensive in which Ukraine took significant territory back from Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ""at this point"" no discussion of mobilization had taken place. What changed? Putin was most likely persuaded by the radical elements within his circle that, given the latest military losses, a drastic escalation was the only way to win the war. And for Putin, winning is the only option. Retreat or compromise is something a Western leader would think about; Russian leaders dont take off-ramps. As such, the escalation is most significantly a signal to the West. Putin is trying to scare the West into the possibility of a larger war and even the use of nuclear weapons to pressure it to limit its crucial support for Ukraine. These radical Russian elements have long been pushing for more far-reaching action. Chief among them is Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful Security Council secretary and close Putin ally, who represents the so-called siloviki (a circle of ultranationalists associated with the security services). Russia expert Marc Galeotti has described Patrushev as ""the most dangerous man in Russia"" because he has pushed Putin further toward extremist positions. Patrushevs friendship with Putin goes back to Patrushevs career as a KGB officer in Leningrad, and experts say Patrushev has had Putins ear for years. Indeed, Galleotti notes, in a lengthy interview to the Russian government outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta in May, Patrushev ultimately calls for Russia to begin a full-scale war. That requires complete mobilization -- as well as total state control of the Russian economy. This past month, other ultranationalist voices have joined in renewed calls for mobilization as well. One prime example is Igor Girkin (aka Strelkov), a former Russian intelligence officer who played a key role in annexing Crimea from Ukraine and the subsequent fighting in Ukraines Donbas region in the east in 2014. Girkin has consistently criticized the Russian Defense Ministrys handling of the war since the start of the invasion. ""If our Kremlin elders do not change their tactics, we will be seeing catastrophic defeats,"" he said earlier this month. More explicitly, Chechnya strongman and close Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, whose troops have been fighting in Ukraine, said in a Telegram post on Sept. 10: ""If today or tomorrow changes are not made in the conduct of the special military operation, I will be forced to go to the countrys leadership to explain to them the situation on the ground."" Days later, he called for mobilization. As Alexey Kovalev, investigative editor at Meduza has written for Foreign Policy, a protest movement of hardliners calling for escalation has largely gone unchecked in its criticism of how Russias leadership has handled the war, although it still has mostly avoided criticizing Putin directly. Unlike other Russians, these hardliners have routinely referred to the conflict as a war. Against this backdrop, the Kremlin warned critics in recent days to be ""very careful."" For the first time, that caution appears to be directed toward hardliners rather than liberal anti-war critics. Putins resort to partial mobilization suggests that hes more afraid of regime hardliners than his own public. The growing criticism means the more extreme elements of his supporters could turn against him and threaten his hold on power in a way the public could not because the hardliners have ties to the security services and are more likely to use violence to achieve their aims. In late 1999, Putin wrote a long essay titled ""Russia at the Turn of the Millennium"" in which he lamented Russias loss of international standing and expressed the fear of Russia losing its unity. Indeed, this fear has consistently stood in the backdrop -- and often the forefront -- of his thinking over the years. Ironically, Putins decisions may ultimately bring about the very thing he sought to prevent. The West, for its part, needs to remember that this is not the first time Putin has issued nuclear threats, and while it would be irresponsible to dismiss it, giving in to blackmail carries its own repercussions. Right now, the Russian military is in no condition to fight NATO, and it is unclear to what extent the partial mobilization will solve Russias military problems. Moreover, the finger on the nuclear button is still that of Vladimir Putin rather than Patrushev or other hardliners. At the same time, the Ukrainians, the most likely victims of any tactical Russian nuclear strike, remain committed to fighting despite the risk. It is now more important than ever to provide them with the support they need. The fight is not only about Ukraine alone: For Putin and the hardliners alike, its about the West. In their view, the West aims to weaken -- if not destroy -- Russia, while the Ukrainian government is a puppet of the United States. Theyre waging this war to preserve Russias right to an imperial sphere of influence, its ability to behave outside internationally accepted norms, and its alternative to the rules-based global order in which small states have as much sovereignty as large states and there is a limit to what a government can do to its citizens. The future of the liberal world order is at stake.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-sees-putin-escalate-internal-reasons-rcna49235

Russian President Vladimir Putins renewed nuclear threats have raised fears that his plans for escalation in Ukraine may not be limited to mobilizing more troops. While he has issued apocalyptic threats against the West before, Putins thinly veiled warnings in a rare national address Wednesday signaled that he was willing to raise the risk of nuclear conflict to avoid an embarrassing military defeat. The Russian leader accused the United States and its allies of ""nuclear blackmail"" and said without elaborating that high-ranking officials from NATO states had made statements about the possibility of ""using nuclear weapons of mass destruction against Russia."" Then he delivered a notable reminder: ""If the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,"" Putin said, an apparent reference to Moscows sizable nuclear arsenal. ""Its not a bluff,"" he added. Whether Kyiv and its allies should now be more concerned about the threat was up for debate, analysts said. ""I think it signals that he wants people to think he would risk nuclear war,"" Phillips OBrien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. ""I dont think it means he is any more likely to do it than he was yesterday."" In his speech in February announcing the start of what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Putin warned that anyone who dared to intervene would face the full force of Russias nuclear arsenal. This time, however, he faces a different reality: His army has experienced humiliating setbacks, his troops are demoralized and depleted, and hes facing rare criticism at home. A ballistic missile rolls in Red Square during a rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade in Moscow on May 7. The Kremlin often uses the occasion to showcase its military and nuclear might. Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP file Desperate for a victory, the Russian leader allied his nuclear threats and call-up of reservists to a plan to annex occupied territory in Ukraines east and south. ""He is doubling down politically because he is losing militarily,"" said Michael Clarke, professor of war studies at Kings College London. ""Creating more 'Russian territory is an attempt to scare the West because Russian nuclear doctrine has always maintained that nuclear weapons would only be used in defense of Russia directly. He says, 'This is not a bluff, which shows that it is."" While the countrys military doctrine limits the use of nuclear weapons to direct threats to the existence of the Russian state, observers noted that in his address, Putin used the ill-defined term ""territorial integrity"" when talking about what conditions would merit a nuclear response. Seemingly extending the conditions for possible nuclear use in the middle of a war, and just as Russia is planning to absorb four Ukrainian regions, means Putin had ""boxed himself in,"" analysts said. ""If Ukraine continues to try and liberate its own territories after a referendum has occurred, a sham referendum, does that mean hes going to attack right away?"" OBrien, the strategic studies professor, said. ""I think he has sort of boxed himself in with this. Its certainly aggressive rhetoric, but its not necessarily intelligent policy."" Kyiv has already indicated that Russias attempts to annex new territories change nothing and vowed its military will keep pushing on the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also skeptical Wednesday that Putin would use nuclear weapons. Washington largely brushed off the threats as irresponsible but nothing new, though NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg denounced Putins ""dangerous and reckless rhetoric."" While they may not be a precursor to nuclear warfare, OBrien said Putins threats should be taken seriously considering Moscows capabilities. ""But I think it should also not be, 'We are going to end up with the end of the world,"" he added. In fact, when Ukraine launched attacks on annexed Crimea this summer, a territory Moscow considers Russian, Putin did not reach for the nuclear button, OBrien noted. ""If he says that any attack on soil that he calls Russia is going to be a nuclear tripwire, Ukraines already broken that in Crimea,"" he added. Putin may also be trying to dissuade Western countries, including the U.S., from supplying Kyiv with more of the weapons it has used to such potent effect on the battlefield, said Keir Giles, a Russia expert and senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London think tank. ""Putins speech is full of indicators that he recognizes Russia has been unable to defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, so it has to look for victory elsewhere. And that victory, Putin hopes, could come through eroding Ukraines international support,"" Giles said. ""That is why Russia is daring the West to support Ukraine further, and appealing to the most fearful and timorous among Western leaders, particularly those who are most susceptible to Russias repeated nuclear threats."" Pro-Kremlin voices have delighted in Putins escalation, which comes after months of state media coverage dominated by talk about the possibility of nuclear strikes on European capitals. As Russian plans to annex new Ukrainian territory emerged Monday, one of the Kremlins top propagandists declared: ""This week marks either the eve of our imminent victory, or the eve of nuclear war.

He Tweets']",Ukraine counteroffensive in war with Russia could prove skeptics wrong,2022-08-30 22:42:00,"Ukraine-Russia war sees credible chance for Kyiv to reclaim Kherson, whatever the skeptics say. Russian President Vladimir Putin won't compromise, so Ukraine must fight.","Kyiv on Monday launched a flurry of attacks into areas of southern Ukraine controlled by Russia, billed as the opening moves of a much-heralded Ukrainian counteroffensive to liberate the key port city of Kherson on the west bank of the Dnieper River. Yet the doubters -- many of whom confidently predicted at the start of the war that Ukraine couldnt possibly resist a Russian invasion and that Western military assistance to Ukraine wouldnt make a difference -- still cant let evidence to the contrary get in the way of their convictions. Broadly, this cohort wants Washington to withhold aid to pressure Kyiv to sue for peace and concede Ukrainian land seized by Russia rather than continue to resist. When Russian forces finally managed to seize two important eastern cities by early July after months of struggling in their war with Ukraine, the defeatists -- from think tank analysts and academics to former foreign policy hands to allegedly anti-imperialist leftists -- again insisted that Ukraine had no hope of prevailing against Russias superior might. In advance of the new operation this week, the doubt continued. A typical argument is that it would take a ""miracle"" for Ukraine to succeed. Broadly, this cohort wants Washington to withhold aid to pressure Kyiv to sue for peace and concede Ukrainian land seized by Russia rather than continue to resist. Give Russian President Vladimir Putin an excuse to declare victory, they claim, and hell take the opportunity to negotiate a peace agreement and bow out with his pride intact. Ukraine is inclined to do otherwise. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, tweeted Monday: ""The only possible option for negotiations with Russia is being conducted by a special Ukrainian delegation in the southern and other directions of the frontline."" Moscow, too, is sending no signals that its ready to discuss a diplomatic resolution. The recent Russian government statement that it still seeks to overthrow Ukraines government, combined with senior officials speaking openly of destroying the concept of a Ukrainian nation (even though both goals now seem unachievable), should dispel wishful thinking that Putin is in a compromising mood. In fact, Russias own military appears more pessimistic about its capabilities than the Ukraine defeatists. Russian operations in eastern Ukraine have decreased markedly in energy since July as Moscow has shifted forces to southern Ukraine in expectation of a Kherson counteroffensive. Thats because both sides can see Russias vulnerability in this sector and how that gives Ukraine a credible shot at liberating Kherson. The southern port city is politically and strategically important. Symbolically it matters because its residents have actively resisted Russias occupation through civil disobedience and armed resistance, unlike many cities in the east that Ukrainian civilians largely evacuated when Russia captured them. In return, human rights groups have observed that Russian troops have kidnapped, tortured or killed many of those resisting, and Moscow is expected to conduct a ""referendum"" aimed at creating a separatist republic in the region. Militarily, the city and its bridges serve as a Russian toehold on the southwest bank of the Dnieper River, which cuts Ukraine in two. Russian control of Kherson allows the Kremlin to continue to use the city as a base to try to capture the neighboring ports of Odesa and Mykolaiv, thereby crippling Ukraines export-based economy. Conversely, liberating Kherson is probably a prerequisite for Ukraine to recapture several other cities. Kyiv made some earlier efforts that didnt bear much fruit in Kherson, but the tables turned by the end of July. Over the last month, Russian ammunition depots began evaporating in massive explosions in precision attacks by rocket artillery systems supplied by the U.S., causing Russian shelling to decline precipitously, according to Ukrainian commanders. Ukraine also picked off Russian air defense systems and killed multiple high-ranking commanders meeting at headquarters, according to Ukrainian reports. Then, this month, Ukrainian forces wiped out numerous Russian warplanes on the ground and blew up depots in adjacent Crimea using still-undisclosed means. This came as a massive shock, as Crimea -- seized by Russian troops in 2014 -- was considered so firmly under Russian control that it has still been frequented by Russian vacationers this summer. At the same time, Russias foothold on the side of a river mostly controlled by Ukraine is inherently hard to defend, because supplies and reinforcements are bottlenecked through a limited number of bridges and ferries. The U.S.-supplied HIMARS artillery has also enabled Ukraine to precisely target these bridges, heavily damaging them. To be sure, no one should take for granted that these strategies guarantee Ukrainian victory. Assaulting prepared defensive positions is usually difficult and costly, and Russia has heavily fortified the outskirts of Kherson. Ukrainian troops must undertake large-scale coordination of infantry, tanks, artillery and airpower to succeed -- a combined arms operation that Ukraines army has little experience performing at such scale. Russia itself has failed disastrously at executing this tricky type of operation. And Ukraine has to fight smartly, because it cant generate the numerical superiority that generally secures a win through brute force (simplistically calculated as a 3-to-1 ratio of attackers to defenders), especially factoring in Russian reserves now deployed nearby. Pulling off a victory likely requires Ukraine to have husbanded a large, fresh force that has received more extensive training than usual, perhaps including drills with NATO instructors elsewhere in Europe. And Ukraines counteroffensive may, at least initially, take the form of several short hops rather than a sustained drive so as not to overtax its forces. So much is uncertain in war. However, this month we have clearly reached the point where Russias military can no longer ""continue their steady advance,"" as Moscows partisans have often bragged -- and it is bracing for Ukraines counterpunch. Accordingly, the West should continue its support of Ukraine so it can take back territories occupied by Russia rather than follow the counsel of pessimists. Some have track records of pro-Putin and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric or openly flaunt their utter lack of concern for anything transpiring outside Americas borders or are so-called anti-imperialists who appear ready to sing the praises of an invasion if its opposed by Washington. Others rightly deplore the horrible violence of this war but are too quick to reward indefensible aggression in hope of a quick resolution. U.S. and European weapons have already helped bring a halt to Russias slow advance in the east and created the potential for Ukraines southern counteroffensive. If that aid can be sustained -- and undeniably, there are challenges and costs involved -- it will make Russias invasion less and less sustainable. Thats ultimately what will gravely weaken the Kremlins illegal occupation of Ukrainian cities and its impetus to take what it wants through force, something thats a threat not only to Ukraine but also to the U.S. and its allies.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ukraine-war-counteroffensive-russia-prove-skeptics-wrong-rcna45546

Russian forces have likely ""withdrawn units from the area,"" but fighting continues around the strategically important cities of Kupiansk and Izyum, it said in its daily update on the war in Ukraine, posted to Twitter. Ukraine's government claims Russia's retreat from Kharkiv is a major turning point in the six-month-old conflict, as thousands of Russian soldiers abandoned their weapons and ammunition stockpiles to flee the Ukrainian advance, they said. Some Western experts have described the withdrawal as the worst defeat for Russian forces since they were forced back from the capital, Kyiv, in March.

He urged that Kyiv and its allies ""strengthen cooperation to defeat Russian terror."" The eastern city of Kreminna -- in the Donbas region, the focal point of the Kremlins war -- was the latest to see Russian troops retreat, according to local governor Serhiy Haidai, while intense fighting continues in several other urban areas. Video released by Ukraines state border service also showed soldiers tearing down a Russian banner from the side of a store in Vovchansk, a town just 2 miles from Russia that was seized on the first day of the war. NBC News has not verified the reports of Ukrainian progress on the ground. Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed ""significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast,"" while speaking on a diplomatic trip to Mexico City late Monday, although he stressed that Russia still has sizable arms and forces in Ukraine. Washington has said that Ukraine was taking advantage of the Western-made weapons now in its arsenal, including U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems. But Kyiv appeared determined to ensure that the apparent shift in momentum was felt in Europe, where evidence of its ability to fight back the Russian invaders was a timely intervention for those increasingly concerned the war's impact on energy supplies might strain working families as well as political will. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter Tuesday that he had heard ""disappointing signals"" from Germany on its willingness to supply new arms. ""What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?"" he asked. The war and the danger to ordinary people are far from over, however. Russian shelling rained down on positions from which President Vladimir Putins troops have withdrawn, according to local officials. ""Of course, it is far from the end of the war, but it is great relief for the Kharkiv people,"" Karina Detyuk, deputy director at the Zoological Park of the city of Kharkiv, which remained under Ukrainian control while large parts of the surrounding region were occupied, told NBC News.

Peace stalks seem far away. And how much money has the U.S. sent to Ukraine anyway? All good questions as Putin's aggression continues.,"Only a few months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus asked a journalist, ""Tell me how this ends."" As the war between Russia and Ukraine passes its sixth month, this question feels timely once again. On Monday, Russias FSB security agency claimed that Ukraines secret services had orchestrated a shocking car bomb that killed the daughter of a close Putin ally, war booster and Russian ultranationalist over the weekend. This claim, made without evidence, could well be a ploy for Russian escalation. While our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Clearly, the situation is changing, which makes any definitive answer to this query impossible. But while our crystal ball may be cloudy, the number of possible outcomes seem to be narrowing. Importantly, war is a ""means,"" not an ""end."" And this war was misunderstood before it even started. Many experts argued that Moscow would never go through with an invasion. Others believed the Kremlin would quickly occupy much of the country, based on Russias overwhelming military superiority. The strength and resilience of the Ukrainian resistance was grossly underestimated. The abilities of the Russian military were terribly overestimated. That poor read of military capability has defined the war thus far. The determination of Ukraine and its Western allies will define it in the future. The West is confronted with another ""long twilight struggle,"" as President John F. Kennedy called it, that will continue even after this conflict ends. Time remains a significant resource on both sides, as Moscow works to hold its populations support together and undermine democratic values. Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly believes he is winning. He is convinced that the willpower and determination of an autocrat is superior to the patience and focus of democracies. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends Navy parade marking Russian Navy Day in St. Petersburg, Russia on July 31, 2022. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images But what has so far helped Ukraine and the West are Putins two enormous strategic miscalculations. He clearly believed Russia could achieve a quick victory, and also thought the West would remain divided and unable to mount a cohesive response. Ukraine pushed the Russians back from the gates of the capital, Kyiv, and they successfully defended their second-largest city, Kharkiv. Their defiant 82-day defense of Mariupol served not only as a rallying point for Ukrainian resistance but as a focal point for Russian military incompetence. It slowed the Russian westward advance, forced the Kremlin to expend substantial amounts of men and materiel, and demonstrated that Putins description of the invasion as a ""special military technical operation"" was patently false. In terms of Western resolve, Putin may have ironically done more for NATO unity than anyone since the end of the Cold War. NATO increased its forces and many member states announced significant increases in their defense budgets. At its recent summit, NATO leaders condemned Moscow, reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, and welcomed Sweden and Finland as new members. The alliance appears strong. But the human and material costs to Ukraine and Russia have been enormous. Russian forces still have a significant advantage in manpower, weapons and ammunition, but there is evidence they are running out of precision-guided weapons and modern equipment. Furthermore, the Defense Department estimates Moscow has suffered over 70,000 casualties so far. That means nearly one half of the Russian force that attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24 are either dead, wounded, captured or missing. Britains top intelligence officer, Richard Moore, the head of MI6, said in July it appeared Russias military was ""about to run out of steam."" Its shortage of willing and competent soldiers is now a major challenge for the Kremlin. Putin has called for more volunteers, yet he has made no announcements about mass mobilization and expanded conscription, nor has he officially declared war or warned his citizens to prepare for more sacrifice. Ukraines major military challenge is a shortage of weapons. Western military equipment has been essential to Kyivs slowing the Russian advance, and the delivery of American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) has had a significant impact. Still, Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly complained that more Western military aid is essential if they are to evict Russian forces from their territory. Its possible Putin hopes to formally annex those portions of Ukraine under Russian control, at least according to U.S. intelligence reports. This includes a sizable portion of the Donbas region and the southern coast. But as the pace slows, both sides have become mired in an artillery slugfest fighting for incremental territorial gains in the Donbas region, as Ukraine appears poised for a counteroffensive in the south. Kyiv has also conducted a series of high profile special operations attacks on Russian air bases and supply line The war could certainly continue to drag along for many months, with neither side able to achieve decisive victory. It is important to acknowledge that fighting in the eastern portion of Ukraine began in 2014 following the first Russian invasion. Over the intervening eight years, over 14,000 Ukrainians were killed and fighting continued intermittently until the invasion on Feb. 24. Putin might consider escalation should a similar a stalemate occur. This could mean ""horizontal escalation,"" including cyberattacks or efforts to foment a crisis somewhere else. (Recent Russian threats against Lithuania and Estonia might be an example.) It could also mean ""vertical escalation,"" including threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine or the West. The number of explicit nuclear threats against the U.S. and its European allies has reached nearly three dozen. Such threats have prevented the West from direct military intervention, but they have failed to fully intimidate or deter either Kyiv or the West. Ultimately, victory for Putin must combine success on the battlefield with political aspiration. Some commentators believe if Russia can secure the Donbas, Putin could declare a cease-fire and seek negotiations. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Henry Kissinger have urged negotiations. Ukraine should prepare to cede land for peace, according to this view. But it is a short-sighted perspective. Putins territorial desires in the Donbas region, while important, are the least of his ambitions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy correctly argued that a cease-fire while Russia occupies Ukrainian territory would actually prolong the war and provide Putin with more time to plan a new attack. His goal to subjugate Ukraine remains. Moscow continues to ""Russify"" the areas it controls by introducing the ruble as local currency, appointing new political leaders, improving its ability to defend occupied territories, and declaring occupied Ukrainian territory as part of Russia. Ukrainian troops patrol at the frontline outside the town of Novoluhanske, eastern Ukraine, on Feb. 19, 2022. Aris Messinis / AFP via Getty Images file Other Russian officials, meanwhile, seem to confirm Putins desire to destroy Ukrainian sovereignty. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, described the goals of the invasion as the end of the Kiev government and of Ukrainian neutrality. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wondered if Ukraine would even ""exist"" in two years. While Putin might accept an interim solution, he seeks -- at a minimum -- a new security architecture in Europe and in a broader sense a new world order. President Joe Biden and his administration must prepare both the American people and our NATO allies for dueling possibilities. The war may become a true slog; it may also end abruptly and messily. Across Europe, there is now widespread concern that Russia may reduce the export of natural gas needed to heat homes for the upcoming winter. Putin may also feel emboldened by a series of shake-ups among Western governments, and because Americans seem increasingly distracted and less interested in the war. Consequently, Biden must both at home and abroad ""transform short-term unity borne of reactive shock into enduring cohesion, borne of affirmative purpose,"" Ali Wyne, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, told The New York Times. Biden must also provide the critical leadership that will ensure that NATO keeps its promise of ""unwavering support for Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" as Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it more than a month before the invasion. In his inaugural address in January 1961, Kennedy observed, ""Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- not as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation."" For Putin and his view of the future to fail, these words must resonate once again. The drama surrounding the car bombing over the weekend, coupled with fears that Russia could be planning an imminent attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, highlight the global stakes of this unpredictable conflict. We may not know exactly how the war ends, but we know enough to understand why the fate of the West and Ukraine remain inextricably, dangerously intertwined.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/russia-losing-war-ukraine-rcna44437

Andrij Melnyk, Ukraines ambassador to Germany, had a curt response to Musks initial poll. ""F--- off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk,"" he wrote on Twitter. Musk also drew direct criticism from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in a dueling Twitter poll accused Musk of contradicting himself. Zelenskyy asked users which version of Musk they like more: the one who supports Ukraine, or the one who supports Russia? That was a reference to Musks early and prominent support for Ukraine after the Russian invasion in February. Musks company SpaceX shipped equipment for its Starlink internet service so Ukrainians could maintain online access to the rest of the world. The dispute began when Musk, the worlds wealthiest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, floated ideas for ending the conflict. His four-point plan included Ukraine ceding Crimea, a region that Russia has occupied by military force since 2014. Crimea is strategically important, for its access to the Black Sea and, by extension, the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic and Indian oceans. Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Ringo H.W.

Late Monday, Musk responded directly to Zelenskyy in a public tweet, saying he still supported Ukraine but feared the consequences of escalating the war.

Crossing the Oskil is another important milestone in Ukraines counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region as it flows south to the Siversky Donets River, which goes right through Luhansk, one of two provinces in the Donbas region. Ukrainian troops ""have pushed across the Oskil. From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,"" the Ukrainian Armed Forces wrote on Telegram late Sunday. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk region, wrote on Telegram: ""Luhansk region is right next door. Decoccupation is not far away."" Zelenskyy vowed to keep up the pressure on Moscow after Ukraines rapid gains in Kharkiv this month.

There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it."" President Joe Biden also said victory for Ukraine meant removing Russian forces from the entire country, and pledged U.S. support for as long as it takes. ""Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely and to recognize the sovereignty. Theyre defeating Russia,"" he said in an interview with CBS ""60 Minutes"" broadcast on Sunday. ""Russias turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were going to be."" Russian artillery pounded towns and villages across the front lines in the east and south Sunday, including civilian infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia city, Ukrainian officials said.

""As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,"" Britains defense ministry said. Ukraines southern command on Monday said strikes were also launched on a radar station near Kherson and on a pontoon crossing near Nova Kakhovka east of Kherson, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive has focused on taking out bridges across the Dnipro and Inhulets rivers. Reuters was unable to independently verify the battlefield reports. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off Ukraines swift counteroffensive and said Moscow would respond more forcefully if its troops were put under further pressure. Such repeated threats have raised concerns that Putin could at some point turn to small nuclear weapons or chemical warfare. Asked what he would tell Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden replied in the CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview: ""Dont. Dont. Dont. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II."" Some military analysts have said Russia might also stage a nuclear incident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant held by Russia but run by Ukrainian staff.

Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for vigilance Sunday after visiting a base in Poland aiding Ukraines war effort.

Thirty-six percent think his approach has been about right, while 8 percent say hes been too tough. But as the war has dragged on, Americans desire to get involved has waned somewhat. Thirty-two percent of Americans say the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict.

For more than two decades now, Putins expanding grip on power has been predicated on his portrayed strength and justified as essential to Russias existence. Over time, as the political opposition and the independent media were gradually whittled away, Kremlin propagandists fostered a sense of inevitability underpinning his continued stewardship. ""Russian society, just as the Russian army, is decaying and falling apart because of corruption."" RUSSIAN SOLIDER PAVEL FILATYEV From the start, Putins invasion of Ukraine has been presented to the Russian public -- and the countrys political elite -- in very similar terms: This war was necessary to secure Russias future existence, it was well-planned and executed, and it will be won. And with near-total control over the information space at home, there has been very little chance for these narratives to be challenged. All of that has changed over the past week. Ukraine has conducted twin counteroffensives to retake territories occupied by Russia -- and achieved success that appeared to stun outside observers as well as the Kremlin. The scale of the Russian militarys and political leaderships setbacks in Ukraine have become too vast for even state media and pro-war activists to ignore. ""The special military operation has completely failed,"" Igor Girkin, who gained notoriety as one of the main leaders of Russias initial efforts in eastern Ukraine back in 2014, said in a video this week. ""Since March, we have had a full-fledged war. But until now, Russian authorities, the defense ministry, and general staff have behaved as if theres no war."" Igor Strelkov, who is also known as Igor Girkin, the top military commander of the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" has thrived on the Telegram messaging service since the start of the war. Bulent Kilic / AFP via Getty Images file Last week, he declared the war ""already lost,"" and warned his audience of nearly half a million viewers that the war would continue until Russias total defeat. Girkin is himself a controversial figure among the marginal but increasingly vocal group of right-wing pro-war bloggers and activists who have thrived on the Telegram messaging service since the start of the war. Their views have traditionally run parallel to official state media messaging but are not firmly under the Kremlins control. With Russian forces on the retreat, more and more they are accusing the leadership of betraying the troops. ""The Kremlin is worried about this panic sentiment,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""The pro-war activists are seen as allies, they are part of the broad pro-Putin consensus in Russia, the disagreement is just about tactics. So, the Kremlin actually has limited means to deal with this camp. They cant turn against them and suppress them the same way they did the liberal opposition."" Even soldiers who have fought in what the Kremlin insists on calling its ""special operation"" are returning home, refusing to go back to the front, and challenging the official narrative surrounding the war. As Ukraine retakes territory, videos are appearing online appearing to show massive amounts of equipment abandoned by retreating Russian soldiers. A Ukrainian soldier standing atop an abandoned Russian tank near a village on the outskirts of Izyum on Sept. 11. Juan Barreto / AFP - Getty Images While the television has told the public that theyve been fighting a good, clean war, soldiers are telling their friends, families and fellow citizens stories of a chaotic, unclear and troubled operation. ""Russian society, just as the Russian army, is decaying and falling apart because of corruption,"" Pavel Filatyev, a Russian soldier who has published a scathing memoir of the first two months of the war, told NBC News. ""So the Russian army often is not acting carefully, they are acting unprofessionally, and a lot of mistakes are being made."" He fled Russia last month after publishing his 141-page account of the war on the Russian social media network VKontakte. NBC News interviewed him in Paris, where he is now seeking asylum. He said that he was stationed in Crimea on exercises before the start of the war Feb. 24, and his unit was sent into the southern Kherson region without sufficient supplies and ammunition. ""Everyone steals as much as they can at each and every level,"" Filatyev said when asked about the reason for equipment shortages. ""On paper, everything is amazing. Our soldiers should be well-fed and happy. But in practice, somewhere along the line the extra food was stolen and sold, same with boots and even bulletproof vests."" His account of the war paints a picture of a military that was left in the dark about Putins intentions before the war began, and under-equipped and mismanaged after troops were ordered into Ukraine. Ultimately, according to Filatyev, the blame falls solely on Putin. ""If you go to Avito and type in bulletproof vest, where do you think those are coming from?"" he said, referring to a Craigslist-style service in Russia. ""Soldiers are stealing and selling them. Obviously, higher ranked people can sell more, such as ammunition. And at the top, its obvious that corruption is through the roof ... because Putin just cant seem to effectively govern the nation."" Accounts such as Filatyevs cast doubt on the Kremlins ability to do one thing that many in Russia now seem to agree is necessary to win the war: mobilization of some form. Over the past few days, this sentiment has started spilling over from marginal radical Telegram channels into the official sanctioned discourse on Russian television. One noteworthy incident took place on a Sunday talk show in which guests openly criticized the war and its goals, with some panelists claiming that Russia will now lose the war unless Putin calls for a full mobilization of the Russian military, which is made up of a mix of paid soldiers and conscripts. But the Kremlin understands this would be an unpopular decision among the pacified and apathetic Russian public. It said this week that mobilization was not yet in the cards and openly warned those who are seen as patriotic dissenters from crossing the line. A woman walks amid the destruction on the streets of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, on April 3. Rodrigo Abd / AP file Destroyed buildings after shelling in Borodianka on April 8. Metin Aktas / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images file ""Critical points of view can be considered pluralism so long as they remain within the bounds of the law,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response to questions about the growing public criticism of the way the war is going. ""But the line is very, very thin, one must be careful here."" A private mercenary group that Western military analysts say has been fighting in Ukraine on behalf of the Kremlin seems to be taking a more central role, even appearing to recruit prisoners to join the war in exchange for going free. NBC News has contacted the Kremlin for comment on the issue. The head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, meanwhile called for regional governors across the country to begin a kind of regional mobilization -- an apparent effort to spare the Kremlin the political trouble of a large and loud general mobilization. Radical right-wing bloggers calling for Putin to take the gloves off in Ukraine are not a direct threat to the regime, Stanovaya said. But their presence in the discourse sends a message to the political elite that backs Putin, undermining their confidence in the leader as the only figure capable of providing stability -- the currency of post-Soviet Russian politics, she says. ""Putins biggest threat is himself,"" she said. ""The problem is his leadership. The Russian elite is used to seeing Putin as a strong man, someone who deals with challenges and always knows where hes taking the country. Now he appears hesitant, he is not convincing at all and he is unclear about Russias goals and plans,"" she added. ""How is Russia going to win this war?""

French President Emmanuel Macron called the planned votes ""cynical"" and ""a parody."" Speaking in New York City, where world leaders are attending the United Nations General Assembly, he told reporters that if the ""idea wasnt so tragic, it would be funny."" Kyiv has been boosted by Western-supplied weapons, including long-range rocket systems supplied by the United States, leading voices on Russian state media to argue that the country is fighting not just Ukraine, but also NATO. Putin has so far resisted calls from nationalist voices and pro-military bloggers for general mobilization, a move that could boost his ailing forces but may prove unpopular with the Russian public. The Russian leader was expected to deliver an address to the nation later Tuesday, further stoking speculation about what he might announce, but had not appeared hours after his scheduled time. One of the Kremlins most hawkish figures, former President Dmitry Medvedev, said Monday that holding the referendums was ""of great importance,"" while signaling that absorbing the Donbas provinces would make encroaching on them equivalent to striking Russia, raising the risk of further escalation if Ukrainian troops continue to advance in the area. The editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed channel RT, Margarita Simonyan, who has been one of the most vocal proponents of the war, also invoked the idea of red lines.

['Mithil Aggarwal'],Ukraine retakes Lyman as Russian retreat deals blow to Putin's annexation,2022-10-02 15:33:58,"Ukraine said it had taken back full control of Lyman on Sunday, handing Russian President Vladimir Putin another setback after he claimed to have annexed the area.","Putin under pressure The setback comes at a delicate time for Putin domestically. While his annexation ceremony was accompanied by patriotic rallies and bullish talk of victory, the Russian leader stoked unease and an exodus of men fearing conscription after he called up hundreds of thousands to join the fight. A new poll released Thursday by the independent Levada Center found that a growing number of Russians said they did not believe the Kremlin's ""special military operation"" was proceeding successfully. It also found that more than half of the 1600 respondents felt anxious or angry about the partial mobilization. The loss of Lyman marks the biggest battlefield shift since a lightning Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month that turned the tide of the seven-month conflict. It sparked a new wave of criticism from pro-military voices online that illustrated the way in which Ukraine's military was now driving the war's direction despite the Kremlin's high-profile efforts to regain the initiative. Infuriated Putin allies such as Ramzan Kadyrov who leads the southern region of Chechnya, demanded a change of strategy in the wake of Saturday's retreat. He called for ""more drastic measures,"" that could even include ""the use of low-yield nuclear weapons"" -- the most explicit call for such an escalation from a top official. ""Ive never seen a country annex territory they didnt even control,"" Phillips OBrien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told NBC News. ""You say this is forever Russia one day and the next day you lose a significant city in it. ""It just shows how weak the annexation really was,"" OBrien added. Strategic importance The Russian retreat this weekend was not just a bad look for Putin but a costly blow to his military. The force of Kremlin troops defending Lyman when Ukraine threatened to surround it ""probably experienced heavy casualties as it withdrew along the only road out of the town still in Russian hands,"" said Britains Defense Ministry in its latest update. Lyman commands a key road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defenses, the ministry added. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the city, which has been used as a logistics and railway hub by Kremlin in the Donetsk region, was a key supply hub to push troops and weaponry to the front lines. ""And without those routes, it will be more difficult. So it presents a sort of a dilemma for the Russians going forward,"" Austin told a news conference in Hawaii on Saturday. Ukraine's military was already seeking to press farther east and has been pressuring Russian defenses in the south for months. The Kremlin is ""trying to mobilize a lot of troops to stop them now, but it looks like theyre going to be really poorly trained troops,"" said OBrien. The battle for Lyman displayed not just Russian weakness but smart Ukrainian strategy that could be crucial going forward, analysts said. In contrast to last month's rapid gains in the northeast, where Ukrainian troops swept through thin Russian lines, Lyman was won by methodically moving to encircle thousands of opposing troops. ""It shows you how theyre going to be taking on Russian formations going forward,"" said OBrien. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly pounded bridges and supply sites behind Russian lines and with Lyman lost, the Kremlin could face more difficulty transporting supplies and troops. It also means more Russian targets will now be in sight of the long-range rockets supplied by Kyiv's Western allies, threatening to further loosen Moscow's grip on that territory ahead of the winter. ""If the Russians were fighting intelligently, theyd probably pull back relatively soon,"" O'Brien said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-retakes-lyman-russia-retreat-putin-annexation-rcna50357
['Mithil Aggarwal'],Why the Crimea bridge blast was such a blow to Putin,2022-10-11 10:35:24,Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday's strikes across Ukraine were revenge for the blast that hit the Kerch bridge to Crimea over the weekend.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has seemingly needed no excuse to spread terror and destruction across Ukraine since launching his full-scale invasion nearly eight months ago. But when he boasted of his militarys Monday morning assault, Putin sought to frame the attacks as revenge for the blast that damaged his signature bridge connecting Russia with the annexed Crimean Peninsula. A massive explosion set the Kerch Bridge ablaze Saturday morning, hitting not just a key supply route for Moscow's forces in Ukraine's south but a site of huge symbolic importance for the Russian leader. The subsequent barrage of deadly Russian attacks against civilian infrastructure was cheered by pro-Kremlin hawks as evidence of the escalation they had been seeking after weeks of battlefield setbacks. ""This was the first attack on critical Russian infrastructure,"" Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer of law and strategy at University of Portsmouth, told NBC News. ""So there is a certain boundary that the Russians would see had been crossed."" The bridge was always an obvious ""red line,"" said the editor-in-chief of Russias state-run RT news channel, Margarita Simonyan, on Monday. She is credited as the writer of the 2018 romantic comedy movie 'The Crimean Bridge. Made with Love!' which was directed by her husband, a sign of the prominence Kremlin allies sought to give the bridge in Russian popular culture. Simonyan was one of many hawkish voices who expressed fury in the wake of the bridge blast and delight at Monday's apparent retaliation. But Kyiv sought to push back against the narrative that the two were directly connected, with Ukraines defense ministry saying that Mondays attacks ""were planned by the Russians since the beginning of October."" The strikes seemingly targeted critical infrastructure ahead of winter, though they also hit a childrens playground. While it was unclear whether the bridge blast and Mondays assault were tied, what was clear is the value of the bridge to both sides.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/crimea-bridge-blast-blow-putin-russia-ukraine-revenge-rcna51377

But don't expect a quick victory.,2022-09-14 13:19:13,Ukraine-Russia war shows Vladimir Putin should be worried as Kyiv advances east and south. But dont expect a quick victory.,"Over the past week, a surprise offensive by Ukraine in northeastern Kharkiv province liberated more territory in six days than Russia captured in months of slow-paced warfare this summer. The advance, spearheaded by tanks and motorized infantry, was the sort of fast-paced mobile warfare that Russia tried and mostly failed to pull off in the first month of its invasion of Ukraine. It was also an effective deception operation. Kyiv had loudly touted plans to counterattack in southern Ukraines Kherson province, and it did actually initiate that campaign on Aug. 29. But all the while, Ukraines military quietly mustered a second force of elite brigades in Kharkiv province in the east, even as Russia was pulling its best troops out of the region to prepare for the Kherson attack. Even Ukraines chief military commander frankly explained in an article a week ago that the countrys current military planning extends into 2023. That meant once Russian defenses in Kharkiv were overrun, the Kremlin had no substantial local reserves to break the counteroffensives momentum. Now pro-Russian military bloggers even fear that Ukraine has quietly husbanded a third counteroffensive force aimed at cutting President Vladimir Putins coastal land corridor to Crimea and Kherson in the south. Whether Ukraine is about to do so or not, the fact that this is a realistic concern shows just how thoroughly the Ukrainian military has seized the initiative and how, after having been severely underestimated by Russia (and many Americans), its capabilities are increasingly rattling even ardent Russian nationalists. These gains have given new fire to Kyivs insistence that it intends not just to roll back Russias conquests since it invaded in February, but also to retake areas in the eastern Donbas region that Russia or Russian-backed separatists seized when fighting erupted in 2014 and that were used as a springboard for the 2022 invasion. While such a victory seemed highly unlikely at the beginning of the summer, it now seems more possible. But its just that, a possibility, and no one should think these recent successes mean Russia will be conceding any time soon. Putin continues to show no interest in real negotiations, and his inner circle still insists that the overthrow of Ukraines government is its ultimate objective. Even Ukraines chief military commander frankly explained in an article a week ago that the countrys current military planning extends into 2023. Many analysts believe Russian forces are too exhausted and depleted to resume major offensive operations soon, so this fall Ukraine will likely try to press its advantage before winter weather slows the pace of operations and buys time for Russia to rebuild its badly mauled ground forces. But Kyiv will have to strike a difficult balance between pushing its battle-weary forces as far as possible to exploit the panic among Russian troops and consolidating its position to avoid overextension and exposing its own exhausted forces to a counterattack. The winter could also provide Moscow with opportunities to cut down Western military support. In retaliation for sanctions the European Union has imposed on Russias energy sector, Moscow has accelerated restrictions on fuel going to Europe and no doubt hopes that the coming cold weather will cause shortages and skyrocketing bills while people need to heat their homes. Russian gas has already declined from 40% to roughly 15% of the E.U.s total consumption, and the Kremlin hopes further reductions could compel European states to come begging for reduced prices in return for lifting economic sanctions and decreasing military aid to Ukraine. Its also possible the Republican Party could recapture the U.S. House and even the Senate in the midterm elections in early November. While some in the GOP have supported military aid to Ukraine, a significant contingent on the Trumpian right is inclined to follow the former president in objecting to such support and could more effectively obstruct U.S. aid packages if it gains power. Moreover, a worsening economy could make sustained military largesse for Ukraine harder for Democrats to back, as well. Western aid visibly played an important role in the offensive of the past week. Long-distance strikes by rockets on HIMARS trucks, informed by intelligence provided by Western allies, helped destroy Russian ammunition depots and logistical hubs in advance of the attack. Ukrainian troops advanced rapidly, using Humvees, armored personnel carriers and tactical trucks donated by the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. They were supported by tanks donated by Czechia and Poland and artillery and anti-aircraft vehicles given by Germany. Western-supplied missiles designed to destroy air-defense radars, shoot down low-flying aircraft and sink ships have also substantially mitigated Russias edge in air and sea power. Such continued support is essential for Ukraines ability to defeat Russia. At present it most needs armored vehicles, artillery and shells; in the long run it needs to replace its old Soviet warplanes with Western ones and adopt longer-range ground-based air defenses. If there is a drop-off in Western military assistance, Putin may believe he is better off prolonging the war until aid is exhausted, while Russias larger economy can make back losses faster than Ukraines. Some of Ukraines strategy, as well, could extend the timeline to allow the country to capitalize on certain opportunities. While Ukraines counteroffensive in Kherson has made some progress, it has gone more slowly than the rapid gains in the east because of the heavier concentration of Russian forces. An optimal strategy would give time for Russian defenses to corrode from within and collapse, as Ukraine has repeatedly knocked out the bridges these forces depend upon for resupply and reinforcement. An overly rushed assault risks heavy casualties and more destruction of Kherson itself. Though Ukraine should press any and all advantage rather than concede ground to Putin, places where it does succeed more quickly could also cause Russia to double down on the fight. The forces that liberated Kharkiv province are now positioned to take back the symbolically important cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk or advance on the key supply hub of Starobilsk, aided by Russias withdrawal from key cities before Ukrainian forces even get there. That raises the prospect that Kyiv might try to roll deeply into Luhansk province and capture cities controlled by Russia since 2014-15. This would be especially humiliating for Putin and remove the minimal gains that would provide him a face-saving victory, which could cause him to dig in even more. But in the end, ensuring Ukraine can continue taking back its territory is the most likely way to convince Putin that a negotiated exit is preferable to more war -- which he could otherwise sustain indefinitely to avoid the appearance of defeat. Ukraines Kharkiv campaign reflected operational excellence, not mere competence. To that end, Ukraine has shown it can effectively use Western assistance and advice to liberate its territory and execute deft maneuvers like smartly targeting a weakly defended rail junction at Kupyansk, near Kharkiv, that served as the only direct railway link from Russias border with northern Ukraine, vital to Russian forces in Kharkiv province because of Moscows reliance on trains for moving troops and supplies. Cutting that primary artery compelled the retreat of much more powerful Russian forces in Izium that risked being surrounded and having supplies of ammunition and fuel reduced to trickles. The same concern weighed on Russian troops throughout the rest of the Kharkiv region -- including in locations that hadnt been directly pressured. Even supporters of assistance to Ukraine have long harbored concerns that Ukraines military lacked the proficiency to switch from primarily defensive warfare to large-scale offense coordinating infantry, tanks and artillery and their supporting logistics. But Ukraines Kharkiv campaign reflected operational excellence, not mere competence. Kyivs allies should keep on providing support to dissuade Russia from continuing to seek a military victory. That should include long-term investments in Ukraines defenses to leave Putin in no doubt that trying to outwait Western assistance is a losing game.

[],Ukraine war: Who is winning?,2022-09-20 09:20:39,"Ukrainian forces have made rapid advances, but Russia still holds 20% of the country.","Ukraine war: Who is winning? Published 20 September Image source, Getty Images Ukrainian forces have made rapid gains in recent days and have recaptured territory in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. However, Russian forces still hold about a fifth of the country. How has the conflict changed? Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, surrounding the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. It also launched attacks in the south, east and north of the country. In early April, Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv, after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital. Russia has since been focusing its military operations in the south, east and north-east of Ukraine, seizing large areas. However, things changed dramatically at the start of September. In a decisive offensive in the north-east, Ukraine drove back Russian forces. It claims to have regained 3,000 square kilometres (1,158 sq miles) of territory around the city of Kharkiv alone. Its forces have also retaken territory in Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine. Since July, the region had been entirely occupied by Russia. In total, Ukraine says it has retaken more than 8,000 sq km (3,088 sq miles) from Russian control in September - its most significant territorial gains since the war started. The cities of Izyum and Kupiansk, which Ukraine says were retaken on 10 September, were both key supply hubs for the Russian forces. As such, these represent important strategic gains. There is also a Ukrainian counter-attack around the Kherson region in the south of the country. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Ukrainian troops have inflicted a ""major operational defeat"" on Russian forces. Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute said Russian positions in Kharkiv had suffered a ""total collapse"". The Russian withdrawal was, he said, ""certainly the most dramatic reverse that we've seen from the Russians since they retreated from Kyiv in April"". How has Russia responded? Russia confirmed that its forces retreated from Izyum and Kupiansk. It said this was a strategic withdrawal to ""regroup"". It has also said it will continue to target these areas with military strikes. The Russian army appears to have abandoned large quantities of equipment and ammunition during the withdrawal. How much territory does Russia still occupy? Russia still holds about 20% of Ukraine, according to the ISW. The areas are largely in the eastern Donbas region and in the south of mainland Ukraine, as well as the Crimea peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014. The Donbas is a mainly Russian-speaking area, and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, pro-Russian forces captured more than a third of the region. It created two so-called people's republics there. Areas in the west of the country, including Lviv, have experienced missile attacks, but no attempt by Russian forces to take and occupy ground. What does Russia want? Russia refuses to recognise its invasion as a war, and says it is undertaking a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The Kremlin said its operations would continue ""until all the tasks originally set"" had been achieved. When launching the invasion in February, President Vladimir Putin said his goal was to ""demilitarise Ukraine"". Image source, Getty Images One objective was to ensure Ukraine didn't join the Western defensive alliance, Nato. Russia's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government. However, it now appears to have limited its ambitions to securing land in Ukraine's east and south. What does Ukraine want? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his main goal is to drive all Russian troops out, to ""de-occupy our whole territory"". Mr Zelensky has appealed for more funding and equipment to retain the areas retaken from Russia. Western shipments of weaponry are being used heavily by Ukrainian forces. How many have people have died? Both sides have suffered losses, although neither publish exact numbers. Ukraine claims it has killed more than 50,000 Russian troops, and at the end of August said it had lost nearly 9,000 military personnel since the start of the conflict. Russia rarely discloses its own troop fatalities. Its most recent death count was in March, when it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began. Image source, Getty Images In July, US officials estimated that about 15,000 Russian soldiers had died. Civilians have also died.

[],Nord Stream 1: How Russia is cutting gas supplies to Europe,2022-09-29 13:45:12,Russia has reduced the amount of gas it supplies to Europe through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.,"Nord Stream 1: How Russia is cutting gas supplies to Europe Published 29 September Image source, Getty Images Nord Stream 1, Russia's largest gas pipeline to Europe, has been closed indefinitely after a number of leaks were found in it and a parallel pipeline, Nord Stream 2. EU leaders say the leaks were caused deliberately. Russia denies it's to blame. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline normally supplies European Union states with about 35% of all the gas they import from Russia. What is Nord Stream 1 and how much gas does it supply? The undersea pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. The pipeline is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Gazprom is also behind the building of a parallel gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which was due to come on stream this year. Germany postponed granting it an operating licence because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How has Russia restricted supplies? Russia has been reducing gas supplies through Nord Stream 1 for a number of months. In June, it cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75% - from 170m cubic metres of gas a day to roughly 40m cubic metres. In July, Russia shut it down for 10 days, citing the need for maintenance. When it reopened, the flow was halved to 20m cubic metres a day. In late August, it shut down Nord Stream 1 entirely, blaming problems with equipment. The pipeline has not been open since then. How was the pipeline damaged? In late September, Norway and Denmark reported four leaks in both the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, near the island of Bornholm. Seismologists say they detected explosions under the sea in the same area. The pipelines were filled with gas at the time, even though the gas was not flowing through them. Huge gas bubbles rose to the surface of the sea, the largest being 1km in diameter. This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Watch: Footage from the Danish Defence of what it says is a gas leak from the pipelines European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has said the pipelines were probably sabotaged, but both the EU and the US have stopped short of naming Russia as the culprit. Russia has denied responsibility. Gazprom says it is ""impossible"" to say when Nord Stream 1 might reopen. David Fyfe, chief economist with research firm Argus Media, says Russia may use the closure to put political pressure on Europe. ""It may hope Europe might pressure Ukraine to recognise territory annexation, in return for Russia restoring pipeline flows,"" he says. How is it hurting Europe? Europe - and in particular Germany - has become increasingly reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Over the past year, Russia has cut its gas supplies to EU states by 88%, according to Mr Fyfe. Wholesale prices of gas in Europe have more than doubled over the same period, he says. Gas prices have risen by a similar amount in the UK, even though it imports no gas from Russia, because the shortages have severely affected the international gas market. The high price of gas is affecting household budgets across Europe and driving up costs for manufacturing firms, says Carole Nakhle from Crystol Energy. ""This could cause slowdowns in European economies and accelerate the route towards recession,"" she says. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Nord Stream 1 previously supplied Germany with the majority of its gas from Russia How is Europe reacting to the supply cuts? EU member states have agreed to cut gas usage by 15%. The German government hopes to reduce gas usage by 2% by limiting the use of lighting and heating in public buildings this winter. Spain has already brought in similar measures and Switzerland is considering doing the same. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany relied on Russia for 55% of its gas. It has managed to reduce this to 35% and wants eventually to reduce imports to zero by importing gas from other countries. Germany is also increasing its use of coal and extending the life of power stations which it had been planning to shut down - despite the negative environmental impact. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The Brandenburg Gate in Berlin had its lights turned off in July Many European citizens are also taking steps themselves. ""In Germany,"" says Ms Nakhle, ""people are buying wood stoves and installing solar panels to reduce gas usage.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60131520
